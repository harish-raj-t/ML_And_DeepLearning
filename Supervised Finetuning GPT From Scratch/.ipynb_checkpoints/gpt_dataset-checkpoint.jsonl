{"text": "Execution Settings for Windows Configurations | ManageEngine Defining Execution \n Settings When you deploy a configuration to client computers, \n the deployment could fail in a few computers due to various reasons. In \n such cases, you can re-deploy the configuration. Desktop Central enables \n you to automate the redeployment process through the Execution Settings \n option. This option enables you to do the following: Specify \n    whether you want the agent to try to apply this configuration in the computers \n    in which the deployment of the configuration failed Choose \n    the number of times you want the agent to try deploying a configuration. \n    You can also specify how many times, out of the number of times that you \n    have specified, you want the configuration to be deployed when: Users \n        log on Computers \n        complete the 90-minute refresh cycle Based on the specified input, configurations will be \n re-deployed on the computers till the depolyment is successful or the retry limit has reached. Configuring Execution Settings You can configure the execution settings while defining \nthe individual configurations or from the  \nconfiguration's details view. To configure execution settings you will have to specifty the following: Retry Configuration on Failed Targets Enable Notifications Retry Configuration on Failed Targets Enabling this option, will retry to apply the configuration on the failed targets. You can choose to specify the maximum number of retry attempts. These retry attempts can be executed during the refresh cycle or user logon. You can break up the number of times you want a configuration-deployment to be retried into the number of times you want it retried during logon or startup and the number of times you want it retried during the refresh cycle. Neither option can be set to zero. For example, if you want an option to be retried 8 times and you set the number of times it should be retried during the refresh cycle to 7, the number of times is should be retried during login or startup will automatically be set as one. Enable Notifications Specify the email address, if you wanted to receive email notifications. These notifications will be begin when the status is moved to \"Ready to Execute\". You can also set a frequency for the notifications to be sent. Notification will be sent only if there is any change in the status, from the previous notification. The example below will explain you more in detail: You have deployed a configuration to a target of 10 computers. The notification settings has been configured to \"Notify via email every 2 hours for 3 days\". The configuration has been moved to Ready to execute status at 10.00 hours. on day 1. The first notification will be sent at 12.00 hours. Assume none of the computers were reachable during the time interval. The notification mail will be sent stating that the configuration is yet to be deployed, and the reason as Agents not reachable. The second notification should be sent at 14.00 hours, however still none of the computers are reachable, and there is no specific change in the status from the previous notification, then the second notification will not be sent. Assume 5 computers were reachable at 15.00 hours, then the subsequent notification will be sent as per schedule at 16.00 hours with the status of the configuration. Top Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp .

It allows you to create different \n task to group the computers and specify a time to boot the machines in \n that task. Waking \n Up Computers Manually Desktop Central has the ability to wake up computers \n within the same subnet and different subnets. When a task is initiated \n to wake up a computer, the target computer's broadcast address is sent \n to the Desktop Central agents which are live in that subnet. Desktop Central \n agent version should be 8.2.93.W or above to perform the wake up task. \n If you are trying to wake up a computer which belongs to a different subnet, \n then at least one of the computer in the specified subnet which has the \n Desktop Central agent should to be live to perform the wake up task. If you try to wake a computer which belongs to a remote  office, \n\t\t then one of the following criteria should be met: IP redirected broadcast should be enabled on the router One of the computer with Desktop Central agent should be \n\t\t\t live in the same subnet, to perform the task. You can Wake computers on LAN manually using Desktop \n Central by following the steps mentioned below: Click the Tools tab Click Wake On LAN Select the specific computers from the list of computers click Wake Up Now you can see that the wake up process has been initiated and the status \n\t will be updated. When computers running on Windows 8 operating system are shutdown, \n\t\t we will not be able to wake up those computers. To know more details \n\t\t on the work around for waking up those computers, refer to this \n\t\t article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2776718 . Creating and Scheduling Wake on LAN Tasks To create a Wake on LAN task, follow the steps below: Step 1: Define Task Select the Tools tab from the Desktop Central client. \n\t This opens the list of tools that can be run on the network machines. Click the Wake on LAN tool listed under the Windows \n\t Tools category to open the task details page. This will list all the \n\t Wake on LAN tasks that have been created. Click the Schedule Wake Up button to create a new \n\t task and specify the following: Provide a name of the task Choose the speed for the Wake on LAN task. Depending \n\t\t upon the selected speed, Desktop Central allocates more threads \n\t\t to complete the task. Waiting time after wake up: Specify the time in \n\t\t minutes after which the status gets updated in the Desktop Central \n\t\t client. Verify the computers already powered up before \n\t\t waking up: Select this option, if you wish to check the status \n\t\t before attempting to boot the machine. Use broadcast to wake up computers: Desktop Central \n\t\t supports sending both unicast and broadcast packets to boot the \n\t\t machines. When this option is not selected, Desktop Central first \n\t\t sends an unicast WOL packet to the machine to boot and check whether \n\t\t the machine is booted. If this fails, it broadcasts the WOL packet \n\t\t in the whole subnet. Resolve IP Address on each schedule: Select this \n\t\t option to resolve the IP Addresses of the machines during every \n\t\t schedule. Step 2: Select computers Click Add Computers button to choose the computers \n\t\t for this task. The selected computers gets added to the table \n\t\t below. Broadcasting of the WOL packtes is based on the \n\t\t subnet address of the computers. If the subnet address is blank \n\t\t of if it is incorrect, the task may fail. You can either click \n\t\t the icon and update the subnet address and Mac Address manually for \n\t\t individual computers ate select the computers in the same subnet \n\t\t and use the Set Subnet Address button to update the Subnet Address \n\t\t of multiple computers. Step 3: Define Scheduler Once: To run the task only once. You need to specify the date and time. Daily: To run the task daily. Specify the time and duration to run the task. Weekly: To run the task on specific day(s) in a week. Specify the time, start \n\t date, and days on which the task has to be run. Monthly: To run the task specific day every month(s). You need to specify starting \n\t time, select a day and select a month/months. Step 4: Deploy Task Click the Submit button to deploy \n this task. The tasks will be run at the scheduled time and interval. The \n status of the tasks and its execution history can be verified from the \n Task Details page.

For more information, see Defining \n Execution Settings Top Reverting Configurations Desktop Central does not take backup of the settings \n that you make when you create configurations. Therefore, it is very important \n that you remember the settings you have made. In most cases, you cannot \n revert the configuration. However, you can modify the settings that you \n had made earlier and re-deploy the configuration. Examples You can modify configurations and re-deploy \n them in the following scenarios: Assume \n\t    that you have deployed a configuration to install a software application. \n\t    You can revert and change it to enable uninstallation of the software \n\t    application. You must modify the configuration by changing the following: Operation \n\t    type from Install to Uninstall Type \n\t    of package The package must have an uninstall string. When \n\t    you want to revert a configuration related to a security policy, you can \n\t    modify the policy and change the settings as required. For example, assume \n\t    that you have created a configuration to disable the option to change \n\t    the wallpaper on the desktop of a computer. You can modify the configuration \n\t    and change the policy to enable the option to change the wall paper, before \n\t    re-deploying the policy. Top Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp .

Ensure \n that you follow the below mentioned prerequisites before trying to connect \n a chat session. Port # 8443/8444 should be open in \n\t the Desktop Central Server.

In case your web browser blocks the Pop \n\t Up, then you will not be able to see the chat window even if the chat \n\t session is initiated successfully. Setting Up Chat You can configure the chat history settings even before we initiate \n the chat session.  Follow the steps mentioned below to configure \n the chat history settings, Click Tools -> Chat Select History and click Chat History Settings Enter the number \n\t of days for maintaining the chat history. If you choose last 30 days, \n\t chat history will be stored only for the last 30 days and the previous \n\t chat history files will be deleted (Only logs will be retained for \n\t voice/video calls). Click Save. Initiate Text Chat To initiate the chat session, follow the steps given below: Click Tools -> Chat Select the name of the user and Click against the specific user name under Action. Request to connect chat session will be initiated \n\t successfully. For more information refer troubleshooting \n\t tips . 'User \n\t\t name' lists all the users who have currently logged in \n\t\t the computer. This list will be refreshed  every  90 \n\t\t minutes. In case of a user being \n\t\t logged on multiple computers, then both the computers will be \n\t\t listed against the user name from which you can choose to initiate \n\t\t the chat session. Voice/Video Chat You can initiate a voice and video chat to provide live assistance to \n your end users. This is applicable only for enterprise edition. There are two approaches to establish communication between \n technicians and end users: Direct communication Communication via Desktop Central server For example, consider a scenario where \n a voice/video call is established between a technician and a user within \n a same remote location and the Desktop Central server is located in a \n different site. In this case, the initial \n connection will be established using the Desktop Central server, however \n further communication will happen seamlessly without the server's intervention \n thus optimizing bandwidth consumption as well. In cases where direct connection \n between technician and user fails, all data transfer will be routed via \n the Desktop Central server. For communication via an intermediate component such as the Desktop \n Central server, you need to ensure: The dynamic port range (49152-65535) should not be blocked by firewall. If you have rerouted Desktop Central Server using NAT settings, \n\t then dynamic port range should also be configured according to the \n\t NAT settings. Initiate a Voice/Video Chat To initiate the chat session, follow the steps given below: Click Tools -> Chat To initiate a voice call, \n\t select the name of the user and click against \n\t the specific user name under Action. To initiate a video call, \n\t select the name of the user and click against the specific user name under Action .

{"text": "Windows XP Firewall Configuration - ManageEngine Desktop Central Configuring Firewall Overview Configuring firewall is one of the most significant task of a system \n administrator. Firewall plays a vital role in securing the data from hackers. \n Desktop Central helps you to deploy customized firewall settings at ease. \n A firewall configuration in general, can be explained as a collection \n of Profiles/Rules. These Profiles/Rules, are applied on a computer to \n determine the permission for all inbound and outbound communication on \n specified ports. Using Desktop Central, you can create new configurations \n to deploy specific settings or modify the existing firewall settings, \n which were not applied using Desktop Central. Understanding Windows Firewall Profiles Before we start creating firewall configuration, let us know more about \n Windows Firewall Profiles. Every computer running Windows operating system, \n connects to internet/network via profiles. There are three profiles for \n Windows computers, they are Domain : This configuration \n\t will be applied to computers, which are a part of the domain. Whenever \n\t a computer reaches the internet/network the restrictions applied on \n\t the firewall of the computer will take effect. This is an ideal example \n\t of how computers work in a business environment. Private : When a computer \n\t is connected to a private network, the firewall restrictions will \n\t be applied to it. Private Network is the one, which is not connected/exposed \n\t directly to the internet. Private networks are configured in such \n\t a way, that a security device like NAT (Network Address Translation) \n\t or a hardware  firewall is precedes the network for security \n\t reasons. This creates a layer of security than Domains. This is configured \n\t in most enterprises to secure their corporate data. Public : This profile does \n\t not have any security devices or restrictions between the computer \n\t and the internet. A good example for public network, is the one you \n\t can find in airports, railway stations, coffee shops etc. You need \n\t to ensure that you have configured firewall in a most secure way, \n\t since these networks in general do not require secured access to reach \n\t the internet. Understanding Rules Rules are settings which provide advanced control for the system administrator. \n A rule is a policy, which can be forced over the profiles. Assume you \n create a profile for Domain and specify to block all inbound communication, \n you can still create a rule to add exception to the specified profile, \n and allow inbound communication to a specific port. Desktop Central supports configuring firewall for computers running \n Windows XP and later versions. Follow the steps mentioned below to configure Firewall Windows Vista and later \n\t versions Windows XP and 2003 Server Windows Vista and later \n versions You should choose the profile to which you wanted to configure the firewall \n like Domain/Private/Public. You can also create a generic firewall configuration \n for all the profiles by selecting all. After specifying the profile, you \n will have to choose the Action, that needs to be performed on the firewall \n like, Do not Modify : Will \n\t\t not impact the existing firewall settings, if any are configured ON : Will turn on the \n\t\t Firewall for the target computer OFF : Firewall will \n\t\t be turned off for the target computer If you have chosen to turn on the firewall, then you will have to specify \n the action for inbound and outbound communication separately. Here are few examples for your reference: Profile All - Applies \n\t to all Domain, Private and Public profiles Action on Inbound : Allow Action on Outbound : Block In this case, all inbound connections will be allowed and all outbound \n\t connections will be restricted on the firewall. Profile Domain - Applies \n\t to computers, only when they are connected to a Domain Network Action on Inbound : Allow Action on Outbound : Block In this case,  all inbound connections will be allowed and all \n\t outbound connections will be restricted on the firewall. Profile Public - Applies \n\t to computers, only when they are connected to a Public Network Action on Inbound : Block Action on Outbound : Allow In this case,  all inbound communication will be blocked and outbound \n\t connections will be allowed on the firewall, when the computer is \n\t connected to a public network. However, if you have applied \n\t any specific rule, to exempt  inbound communication for a specific \n\t port, then the inbound communication will be allowed only the specified \n\t port . You can create specific rules to exclude specific functions like inbound/outbound \n communication on specific ports.  When you create a rule, you will \n have to specify a name for the rule, and specify to which profile should \n this rule be applied, like Domain/Public/Private. You should also specify \n the port number/ protocol and the action to be performed as exception. \n You can create one or more rules for the same profile. You can choose the target, specify the execution settings and deploy \n the configuration. You have successfully configured the firewall settings \n on computers running Windows Vista and later versions. Windows XP and 2003 Server If you wanted to configure Firewall on the computers running \n\t\t Windows XP, then ensure that Windows XP Service Pack 2 is installed \n\t\t on those computers. You can choose the Action, that needs to be performed on the firewall \n like, Do not Modify : Will \n\t\t not impact the existing firewall settings, if any are configured ON : Will turn on the \n\t\t Firewall for the target computer OFF : Firewall will \n\t\t be turned off for the target computer After specifying the Action on Firewall, you will have to specify the \n Action that needs to be performed on specific ports. You can choose the \n action that needs to be performed on the ports like, Do not Modify : Will \n\t\t not impact the existing settings, if any are configured Allow : All connections \n\t\t inbound/outbound will be allowed for the port, that you choose. \n\t\t You will have to choose/add the port/protocol and specify the \n\t\t dependent services if any. Block : All connections \n\t\t inbound/outbound will be blocked for the port, that you choose. \n\t\t You will have to choose/add the port/protocol and specify the \n\t\t dependent services if any. You can choose the target, specify the execution settings and deploy \n the configuration. You have successfully configured the firewall settings \n on computers running Windows XP.

Deployment \n will be initiated during the next system startup. To save the configuration as draft, click Save \n as Draft . Note : Patch \n\t\t Uninstallation is currently not supported for Mac Computers Creating \n a configuration from All Patches View If \n you are trying to create a configuration from Detailed \n View under All \n Patches, then the below mentioned \n scenarios will come into effect. Detailed view will list every missing \n patch against every single computer in a separate row, which means if \n a single patch is missing in 5 computers, 5 rows will be listed. when y ou \n have chosen to deploy more than one patch for more than one computer as \n mentioned below, then you might end up in deploying the patches to the \n computers which you never intended to deploy. Creating a configuration based on the \n above selection will work as follows: Selected Patches: Patch \n 1, Patch 2  and Patch 3. Defined Target : Computer 1, \n Computer 2,  and Computer 3. Result of this Deployment: Patch ID Included Target Intended \n\t\t target Missing \n\t\t Patch Deployment \n\t\t Initiated Expected  Result Patch 1 Computer 1 Yes Yes Yes Will be deployed Patch 1 Computer 2 Yes Yes Yes Will be deployed Patch 1 Computer 3 No No Yes Will not be deployed Patch 2 Computer 1 No Yes Yes Will be deployed Patch 2 Computer 2 Yes Yes Yes Will be deployed patch 2 Computer 3 No No Yes Will not be deployed patch 3 Computer 1 No No Yes Will not be deployed Patch 3 Computer 2 No No Yes Will not be deployed Patch 3 Computer 3 Yes Yes Yes Will be deployed As per the above mentioned table, the configuration will be deployed \n across to all the computers to which the patch is applicable. Patch \n 2 is applicable for computer 1, but you never intended to deploy it, however the deployment will \n happen on it, since it is a missing patch. In order to overcome this, it is recommended to deploy multiple patches \n to single computer or single patch to multiple computers from \"Detailed \n View\". If you want to deploy multiple patches for multiple computers, \n then it is recommended to create multiple configurations or initiate deployment \n from Missing Patches View. Note: When a Patch \n\t\t Management task is initiated, Desktop \n\t\t Central agent residing \n\t\t on the client computer scans the computer for the missing patches \n\t\t and downloads only the applicable patches from the Desktop Central \n\t\t server. If you are managing computers in a remote office using a Distribution \n\t\t Server, then WAN agents will download the applicable patches from \n\t\t the Distribution Server. However the deployed patches will be \n\t\t replicated to the Distribution Server irrespective of whether \n\t\t the patch is applicable for the remote office computers or not.

{"text": "Power Management for Computers | ManageEngine Desktop Central Power Management for Computers The Power Management Configuration enables you to adjust your power \n settings to save energy. You can add, modify, and delete power schemes \n for computers from a central point. You can cut down the cost that is \n spent on power, when the computers are idle. You can create specific power \n schemes and apply it to computers via configurations. Desktop Central supports power management only for computers running Windows \n Vista and later versions.  You can perform the following operations \n on idle computers by creating power schemes: Action to be performed Impact on the target Dim the Display Only the computer display's brightness will be reduced to save \n\t\t power. Turn Off the display Computer's display will be turned off and the power consumption \n\t\t will be reduced reasonably Turn Off to Sleep Computer turns to standby mode, all working files/data will \n\t\t be stored on memory. Power consumed will be relative very low System Hibernate All working files/data will be stored on the hard disk \n\t\t and turns off the computer. Zero power is consumed Turn Off Hard disk Only the hard disk will be turned off, computer will not be \n\t\t shutdown. Power consumption will be cut down considerably Hybrid Sleep* (applicable for Windows 7 and later versions) All working files/data will be stored on the hard disk \n\t\t and the computer turns to sleep. Assume a computer has turned \n\t\t off without power, it still restores the working files and resumes \n\t\t back to work, when it is boot up the next time. The above listed operations can be \n executed on the computers based on the idle time and mode of power supply \n such as plugged in and battery mode. After customizing the power \n schemes, you can choose to apply the power scheme as follows: Overwrite the existing power schemes with the latest one, that you have created. If more than one power \n\t scheme exists with the same name, you can choose to overwrite the \n\t previous one with the latest. Set the newly created power scheme \n\t as active power scheme , if you do not set it as active, then \n\t the power scheme will be deployed to the computer. You will have to \n\t apply/activate it manually for the power scheme to work. You can choose to enable , support for hibernate . If \n\t you do not enable support for hibernate, then the option to hibernate \n\t will not work, even if it is specified in the power scheme. You can choose to enable hybrid \n\t sleep for computers, running Windows 7 and later versions. \n\t \"Hybrid sleep\" can be applied for computers, running Windows \n\t 7 and later versions. It stores all data and working documents on \n\t the hard disk and turns the computer to sleep, which means the power \n\t consumed is relatively less. Assume a computer has turned off without \n\t power, it still restores the working files and resumes back to work, \n\t when it is boot up the next time. You can create/modify/delete power schemes using Desktop Central. By \n clicking on configurations tab, on Desktop Central web console, you can \n choose power management configuration. You can choose to create customized \n power schemes or modify the default power schemes provided by the operating \n system. Windows provides, three schemes such as Balanced, High Performance \n and Power Saver schemes. If you wish to delete a power scheme, you will \n have to specify the name of the power scheme and deploy it to the target \n computers. You can execute advanced options like: Prompting for password, when the computer resumes from sleep Actions which needs to be performed, when the laptop's lid is closed Actions to be performed, when the power button is pressed Actions to be performed, when the sleep button is pressed These actions can be customized, based on the mode of power, like plugged \n in mode or when it runs on battery.

Using this configuration, you can block or unblock \n the following devices: Mouse Disk drives \n\t (for example, USB drives and external hard-disk drives) CD ROMs Portable devices \n\t (for example, mobile phones, digital cameras and portable media players) Floppy disks Bluetooth \n\t devices Images (for \n\t example, USB cameras and scanners) Printers Modems Apple USB \n\t devices (for example: iPhone, iPad and iPod touch) You can also exclude devices using the Vendor ID or \n Device Instance ID assigned to each device. Applying \n Secure USB Settings to Computers When you apply the Secure USB configuration to both \n computers and users, the settings made for computers will be applied before \n the settings made for users. For example, assume that you have made the \n following settings: Settings \n\t configured for users Administrator: \n\t\t You have unblocked the usage of the disk drive Other \n\t\t users (excluding the administrator): You have not deployed any \n\t\t configurations Settings \n\t configured for computers : You have blocked the usage of portable \n\t devices and disk drives The following actions will take place: Computer startup: \n\t The Secure USB configuration settings made for the computer are applied \n\t when the computer is started. This means that no portable devices \n\t and disk drives can be used. Administrator \n\t logon: The Secure USB configuration for the computer is applied. However, \n\t it is over written by the settings made for the administrator. This \n\t means that the administrator can use disk drives. Other users \n\t (excluding the administrator) log on: The Secure USB configuration \n\t made for the computer is applied. Other users \n\t (excluding the administrator)log off: The log off-action settings \n\t made for users are applied when a user logs off. If the log off-action \n\t setting is set to Don't alter device status, then the settings made \n\t will apply to the next user who logs on, provided that the user does \n\t not have any settings that apply to them. Note : Block USB , represents\n\t\t\t to block the access to use any USB device. Unblock USB, represents to re-enable the access to the USB devices that\n\t\t\t has been blocked. No Change, represents\n\t\t\t that no change has been made to the current settings. Adding Restrictions \n to secure USB Devices As an administrator, you can create a configuration \n block or unblock specific USB devices. You can also exclude specific devices, \n if required. To create a configuration to secure USB devices for \n users, follow the steps given below: Click the Configurations tab Click Configuration Under Computer \n\t Configurations section click Secure \n\t USB Enter a name and description \n\t for the configuration Click Add to apply restrictions To add restrictions, select \n\t the devices, choose to block or unblock devices. When you have chosen \n\t to block devices, you can also specify the devices which needs to \n\t be excluded . Define \n\t the target Specify the required execution \n\t settings Click Deploy You have created configurations to secure USB devices. These configurations \n will be applied when the user logs in to the computer. Excluding Devices When you block a device \n you can exclude certain devices from being blocked. This can be done, \n by using Vendor ID or the Device Instance ID assigned to each device. \n You can exclude devices only when you have blocked a device. To exclude \n devices, follow the steps given below: Click the Exclude \n\t Devices link against a device Enter the Device Instance ID for the device. \n\t You can also choose to block all the devices, from the specified vendor . You will have to specify\n\t the Device Instance ID using which, Desktop Central will fetch the \n\t vendor instance ID and exclude all devices from the specific vendor. You can choose to exclude All Encrypted devices/encrypted devices \n\t from the list of specified devices. Devices that are encrypted \n\t using  bit locker can be added to the exclusion list. This \n\t is applicable only for Disk Drives and the target computer supports \n\t bit locker. Click Close You have excluded a device \n from being blocked. Device Instance \n ID Every USB device has a unique \n ID. This ID is assigned to devices by the system to identify them easily. \n You can identify the Device Instance ID of a Device by following the steps \n mentioned below: Right-click My \n\t\t Computer Click Properties Click Device \n\t\t Manager (Refer to the figure below) From the list of devices, \n\t\t expand the list of devices for which you want the Device Instance \n\t\t ID. (For example : if you want to identify the Device Instance ID of \n\t\t a mobile phone that you have connected to the computer, expand \n\t\t portable devices and follow the next step.) Figure 1: Device Manager Right-click on the name\n\t\t of a specific device and click Properties (Refer to the figure below) Figure\n\t 2: Properties Click the Details tab In the drop-down\n\t\t\t box, select Device Instance\n\t\t\t ID or Device Instance Path (Refer to the figure below) Figure\n\t 3: Device Instance ID In\n\t\t\t computers which have the operating system Windows Vista (and\n\t\t\t later versions), the Device Instance ID is called the Device Instance Path . You\n\t\t\t can copy the Device Instance Path from the Properties property\n\t\t\t sheet of the Device Manager. In computers that have older versions of the Windows operating\n\t\t\t system installed in them, you cannot copy the Device Instance\n\t\t\t ID directly from the Properties property sheet of the Device\n\t\t\t Manager. To copy the Device Instance ID you must open the dcusbaccess\n\t\t\t log file. This file is located in <Drive>\\<Desktopcentral_Agent \n\t\t\t Folder>\\logs\\dcusbaccess.log. It contains information\n\t\t\t about the following: Action Time (inserted\\removed time) Action (inserted\\removed) Friendly name Device Instance ID You can now view and \n\t copy the Device Instance ID for a specific device. Revoking \n All USB Restrictions applied to the Computer Administrators can choose to revoke all USB related restrictions which \n are applied to the computer. To create a configuration, in order to revoke all \n USB related restrictions for users, follow the steps given below: Click the Configurations tab. Click Configuration. Under Computer \n\t Configurations section click Secure \n\t USB. Enter a name and description \n\t for the configuration. Click Remove to revoke all restrictions applied to the computer.

{"text": "Adding a Domain/Workgroup | ManageEngine Desktop Central Adding Domain/Workgroup A windows network is typically based on Windows Active Directory, Workgroup,\nor Novell eDirectory. When you install desktop Central in your network,\nit automatically discovers all the domains and workgroups available in\nyour network. Novell eDirectory based network are discovered and managed\nas workgroups in Desktop Central. Discovering\nDomains / Workgroups To view the discovered domains/ workgroups or to initiate the discovery,\nselect Admin tab --> Scope of Management (SoM)  --> Computers tab -->\nAdd Computers . This will list all the computers belonging to a domain. Adding Domains Domain can be added in Desktop Central in three ways: From the list of computers available in the SoM --> Add Computers page\nselect the computers that need to be managed using Desktop Central. Domains can be added manually but, if for some reason,\none or more domains are not discovered, you can use the Add\nDomain icon available in the same page to add domains manually. Navigate to Admin tab --> Global Settings --> Domain --> Add Domain All the above options will open the Add\nDomain dialog for accepting the following information: Parameter Description Type Domain Name Name of the domain. This is usually the netbios\nor the pre-2000 name of the domain Mandatory Network Type Select \"Active Directory\" option Mandatory Domain User Name This should be the\ndomain user name that has administrative privileges in all the\ncomputers of that domain. It is recommended to have a dedicated\ndomain admin user account for Desktop Central whose password policy\nis set to \"Never Expire\" Mandatory Password Password of the domain admin user Mandatory AD Domain Name The DNS name of the Active Directory\nDomain Mandatory Domain Controller Name The name of the domain controller.\nIf you have multiple domain controllers, provide the name of the\ndomain controller that is nearest to the computer where Desktop\nCentral Server is installed Mandatory Enable the checkbox to use LDAP SSL By enabling this checkbox, the communication between Desktop\n\t\tCentral server and Active Directory will be secured. The default port used is \n\t\t636. Optional If you have problems in adding the domains, refer to our online\nknowledge base for possible reasons and solutions. Adding Workgroups Similar to domains, workgroups can be added in Desktop Central in three\nways: From the list of computers available in the SoM --> Add Computers page\nselect the computers that need to be managed using Desktop Central. Workgroups can be added manually but, if for some reason,\none or more workgroups are not discovered, you can use the Add\nDomain icon available in the same page to add workgroups manually. Navigate to Admin tab --> Global Settings --> Domain --> Add Domain All the above options will open the Add\nDomain dialog for accepting the following information: Parameter Description Type Domain Name The name of the workgroup Mandatory Network Type Select \"Workgroup\" option Mandatory Admin User Name A common user name\nwhich has administrative privileges in all the computers within\nthat workgroup. It is recommended to have a dedicated user account\nfor Desktop Central whose password policy is set to \"Never\nExpire\" Mandatory Password The password of the common admin\nuser Mandatory DNS Suffix This is required to uniquely identify\na computer within a workgroup. For example, if you have a computer\nwith the same name in two different workgroups, the DNS suffix\nis used to identify it uniquely Optional If you have problems in adding the workgroups, refer to our online\nknowledge base for possible reasons and solutions.

{"text": "Configuring Deployment Policies | ManageEngine Desktop Central Configuring Deployment Policies When you deploy a software or a patch using Desktop Central, you can \n specify multiple Deployment Settings like when to install, whether the \n user can skip deployments, reboot policies, etc. These deployment settings \n can be created as Policies, which can then be used while defining the \n configurations/tasks. Any \n policy can be marked as a default policy, so that it will be applied by \n default for all subsequent configurations/tasks that are created. There are several ways to create deployment policies: Policies can be created from the Deployment Policies page.

{"text": "Failover Server Settings | ManageEngine Desktop Central Configuring Failover Server \"Downtime\" is a threat to every enterprise, which would affect \n productivity.  Desktop Central offers \"Failover Service\", \n to overcome these challenges. You can configure a secondary server, which \n will act as a standby server, whenever the primary server fails. This \n will ensure, that the desktop management system is not aborted due to \n any hardware surprises. This document will explain you the steps involved \n in configuring the failover service. This feature is supported for computers \n running Windows XP and later versions. Prerequisites You need to ensure that the below listed criteria are met, before configuring \n the failover service: License for Failover Remote MSSQL Database Remote Repositories Patch \n\t\t Store Software \n\t\t Repository Static IP Address Failover is supported only for MSSQL databsae. You should have purchased \n license for failover and uploaded it in the product. You need to ensure \n that the database, patch store and the software repository are installed \n in a remote computer. This will ensure that the database, patch store \n and software repository are not affected, when one of the server is down. \n You should also ensure that the IP Address, that you configure for the \n primary server and the secondary server is \"Static\". So, that \n the communication will reach the appropriate static IP address. Ensure that the Desktop Central's primary server, secondary \n\t\t server and the remote database (if any) belongs to a same domain and are located in a same subnet. \n\t\t  If you have configured NAT settings to redirect all communications \n\t\t to a local IP, you will have to ensure that the redirected communications \n\t\t reach the virtual IP address. Configuring Failover Server You can configure failover service from here: Desktop Central web console \n -> Admin - > Failover Server. You will have to specify the Primary \n and Secondary Server's IP address. You will have to provide a virtual \n IP address, which could actually be updated to the agents. Every communication \n from the agent, distribution server will reach the virtual IP. If you \n have configured NAT settings to redirect all communications to a local \n IP, you will have to ensure that the redirected communications reach the \n virtual IP address. All request that reaches this virtual IP will be redirected to the primary \n server, whenever the primary server is not reachable, the communications \n will be taken to the secondary server. The secondary server will periodically \n sync all the data from the primary server, so that it is up-to-date. You \n can also configure settings to receive mail notifications, whenever one \n of the server is down, or not reachable.  Follow the steps mentioned \n below to configure Failover server: Clone Server components to secondary server Configuring Secondary Server Activate Secondary Server Clone Server components to secondary server Perform the following steps on the computer, where (Primary) Desktop \n Central server is installed: Stop Desktop Central server Navigate to <Installation_Directory>/ManageEngine/DesktopCentral_Server/bin Execute \"Clone_Primary_Server.bat\", to clone and create \n\t a zip folder which contains the server components. A new zip file \"Product.zip\", will be created \n\t in the \"<Installation_Directory>/ManageEngine/DesktopCentral_Server>\" folder. Configure Secondary Server Ensure that the the secondary server do have permissions to \n\t\t synchronize the data from the primary server and vice versa You will have to enable the following settings: Access to computer where \n\t Desktop Central Primary & Secondary Server are installed. Permission for the admin user to manage both the Desktop Central Primary & Secondary Server. The below mentioned steps should be performed on the primary server \n first and the same should be performed on the secondary server during \n activation. Steps for Sharing: Right click on the folder choose Sharing tab Click Advanced Sharing Enable Share this \n\t Folder Specify the name as DesktopCentral_Server Click Permissions Click Add Choose Object Types Enable Computers, Click OK Under Enter Object Name, specify the secondary server name and the user name with Admin privileges Click share permission and select user and computer and ensure that Full Control is enabled Click OK , \n\t to complete the process. If Desktop Central server is installed in Windows \n\t\t\t 10 or Windows Server 2012 R2, you will have to ensure that \n\t\t\t the permissions are modified here, (Right click) Desktop Central \n\t\t\t folder -> Properties -> Security -> Edit Permissions \n\t\t\t -> Edit -> Add (add the name of the secondary server). Activate Secondary Server Perform the below mentioned step on the computer where the Secondary \n server is installed: Download the Configure_Failover_Server.bat from the product : Desktop Central web console ->\n\t Admin -> Failover Server Open Command Prompt as an administrator and navigate to the location where you have downloaded the .bat file and execute Configure_Failover_Server.bat <PrimaryServer_IP> Repeat the steps for sharing , \n\t as mentioned above on the secondary server and ensure that you provide \n\t name of the computer, where the primary server is installed, in step \n\t 10. You can now see that the server components are replicated to the secondary \n server. Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp . All Rights Reserved. ManageEngine"}

{"text": "Assuming users' mobility, Desktop Central Server should be reachable via public IP address. So that devices in LAN and WAN can be managed all the time. There are two approaches in configuring the NAT settings. The two approaches are explained below: Exposing Desktop Central Server to the Internet Exposing Desktop Central Secure Gateway Server to the Internet Exposing Desktop Central Server to the Internet: Desktop Central Server should be reachable via public IP address, you can configure the NAT settings in such a way that all the request that are sent to the Public IP address gets redirected to the Desktop Central Server. For devices within the LAN If you use the same DNS name for both public and private IP, then all internal requests within the LAN will be directed through the internal DNS to reach the private IP without getting routed through the public IP. For devices in WAN Devices from WAN uses the DNS name to reach the public IP address from where it gets directed to the private IP address. It is recommended to use FQDN instead of IP address. You can also use self signed or third party certificates to ensure data security. ��Since using certificates will encrypt the communication which is the sent to and from the server, this assures that the corporate data is secure in the internet. When you use any third party certificates it recognizes the server using the FQDN. To know more about using third party certificates,�� refer to this. �� Exposing Desktop Central Secure Gateway Server to the Internet: This section explains you about managing desktops and devices without exposing the Desktop Central Server directly to the internet. ����This can be achieved with the use of a Secure Gateway server. This ensures that the Desktop Central Server is secure from risks and threats from vulnerable attacks. Desktop Central Secure Gateway server is a component that will be exposed to the internet. This Secure Gateway server acts as an intermediate between the managed desktops, devices and the Desktop Central server. Desktop Central server communicates with the APNs/GCM to wake the mobile device. All communications from the mobile device will be navigated through the Secure Gateway server. When the device tries to contact the Desktop Central server, secure gateway server receives all the connections and redirects to the ��Desktop Central Server. When an on-demand task is performed, computers within the LAN, will contact the Desktop Central server directly using the FQDN. Computers which are outside the corporate network will reach the secure gateway  server, which in-turn will route all requests to the Desktop Central server. Configure NAT settings to locate the Desktop Central Server To configure NAT Settings, follow the steps below: Select the��MDM��tab Click��NAT Settings��under��Settings��from the left pane. The details of the Desktop Central Server and the ports are pre-filled based on your current setup.

{"text": "System Health Policy Settings | ManageEngine Desktop Central Configuring System Health Policy What is System Health Policy? Desktop Central periodically scans the systems in your network to identify \n the missing patches. The missing patches include both the operating system \n and third party application patches pertaining to that system. Generally, \n patches are released with varying severities ranging from Low to Critical. \n Based on these patch severities, Desktop Central classifies the system \n into three categories to quickly identify the health status of the systems \n in the network. Health policy of the systems are calculated based on the \n missing security updates and third party updates. It is recommended to \n deploy all the security and third party updates to maintain the health \n status of the systems.  If you do not want a specific missing patch, \n to impact the system health status, then you can choose to decline \n the patch . Patches that are declined will not be considered for the \n System Health Status calculation. How are the systems classified? Based on the severity of the missing patches, the systems are categorized \n as Healthy, Vulnerable, and Highly Vulnerable in Desktop Central. The \n default health policy is as below: Healthy Systems are those that have up-to-date patches \n\t installed Vulnerable Systems are those that have missing patches \n\t in \"Moderate\" or \"Low\" severity levels. Highly Vulnerable Systems are those that have missing \n\t patches in \"Critical\" or \"Important\" severity \n\t levels. The patches that are declined will not be considered for arriving at the system health \n\t\t\t\t status. You can choose to exclude \n\t\t\t\t all 3rd party patches from system health calculation. Customizing Patch Severity You can customize the criteria to determine the health of a system. \n You can specify the number of patches, which will be considered as a bench \n mark to rate a system as highly vulnerable or vulnerable. Refer to the \n example explained below: Criteria specified to mark a computer a highly vulnerable: 3 or more critical patches are missing 3 or more important patches missing 0 Moderate Patches are missing 0 Low severity patches are missing. Criteria specified to mark a computer a vulnerable: 2 or more critical patches are missing 1 or more important patches missing 1 Moderate Patches are missing 0 Low severity patches are missing. Based on the above mentioned criteria, if 3 or more critical patches \n are missing, then a system will be marked as highly vulnerable. If only \n 2 critical patches are missing, then it will be marked as vulnerable. \n If 1 critical patch is missing system will be considered as healthy. Assume \n 5 moderate severity patches are missing, then the system will be marked \n as Vulnerable. If 10 low severity patches are missing, system will still \n be considered as healthy, since you have not specified any number in the \n criteria. You can configure the above explained settings by following the \n steps mentioned below: Select the Admin tab and choose Patch Mgmt . Click the System \n\t Health Policy link available under Patch Settings . Specify the number of missing patches to determine \n\t the health status of a system, based on severity and count of missing \n\t patches Under Advanced Settings, choose to exclude \n\t 3rd party patches from system health calculation Click Save Changes . Excluding 3rd Party Patches \n from System Heath Calculation Most of the times, significance of missing 3rd party patches do not \n precede over the patches related to operating system. This could be because \n of the vast number of 3rd party applications and its real need towards \n the business. If you consider that your system's health should not be \n determined based on the missing 3rd party patches. You can configure your \n system health in such a way, that even if one or more 3rd party patches \n are missing in your system,  it can still be rated as healthy if \n all OS related patches are installed on it. You can exclude all the 3rd \n party patches and choose to include few of those which might be needed. You can choose to calculate the system's health, only based \n\t\t\t on the approved missing patches. This can be specified only \n\t\t\t if you have chosen to approve patches manually. If patch approval \n\t\t\t settings is configured as automatic, then all the patches \n\t\t\t will be approved by default and considered for system health \n\t\t\t calculation.

The csv should contain the name of the \n\t\t computer followed by the domain name as explained below: Computer Name,Domain Name system101,companyorg Dynamic \n Custom Group A Dynamic Group is the one that is created with a set of rules or criteria. \n Based on the defined criteria, the computers gets automatically added \n to this group. Any new computer matching the criteria will automatically \n get added to this group. The computers belonging to this group are generated \n only during the execution configuration. The defined queries will be applied \n and the result will be published as the Dynamic Custom Group. Create \n a Custom Group To create a custom group, follow the steps below: Select the Admin tab Click the Custom \n\t Groups link available under the Global Settings. This will \n\t list all the Custom Groups that have been created. Click the Create \n\t New Group button and specify the following values: Specify a name for the custom group. This should \n\t\t be unique. Select the Domain or the Workgroup from the list. Select the Group \n\t\t Type as Computers or Users. This will list the available \n\t\t computers/users in the selected domain. Note : By default, the \n\t\t users/computers will be displayed in Tree View. Use List \n\t\t View link to view users/computers as a list. Manual entry \n\t\t of computers/users is possible using Manual \n\t\t Input option. Select the computers/users and move them to the \n\t\t Added list. Click Submit to create the group. Repeat step 3 & 4 for creating more groups. List \n View Click on the List View link for \n\t\t the users/computers to be displayed as a list. Click on a particular alphabet to view the users/computers \n\t\t with names that begin with alphabet specified. Use All link to list all the users/computers. Click on the Sort link to sort \n\t\t the listed user/computer names. Ignore \n Prefix You can use the \" Ignore-Prefix \" \n option in combination with your choice of alphabet. This will list all \n users/computers that have the specified prefix and whose names begin with \n selected alphabet. For example, the figure below shows a case where DC is specified in Ignore-Prefix and the alphabet chosen is W . \n The resultant list therefore shows all the computers who have ' DC ' \n as their prefix but whose names begin with alphabet ' W '. Add \n Computers Manually Click on the Add tab for the users/computers to be manually added. Specify a valid User/Computer in the text field. Click on >> button to add \n\t\t the user/computer in the custom group. Incorrect User/Computer will not be added and the application \n\t\t\t\t will throw an error. In that case, specify the correct \n\t\t\t\t User/Computer name and add it again. Click on Create Group button \n\t\t to complete custom group creation. You have successfully created a custom group, \n which can be used for management purposes. Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp . All Rights Reserved. ManageEngine"}
{"text": "Credential Manager | ManageEngine Desktop Central Credential Manager Overview Desktop Central requires credentials like user name and password to \n perform various desktop management activities inside the product, say \n for adding a domain or workgroup, for accessing a network share to deploy \n software, for deploying certain configurations etc., These credentials \n details are collected at different places dependent on where they are \n required, and managing them across the product is tedious and time consuming. \n Credential Manager provides a unified solution to store and manage all \n these credentials globally from a centralized location. Understanding Credential manager Credential manager validates the domain credentials while you add them \n and the invalid credentials are not accepted. Any changes related to the \n user name or password of domain credentials are notified to you in the \n form of alerts. Thus you can incorporate these changes globally using \n credential manager, instead of changing them in all the areas across the \n product. Other workgroup and user credentials are not validated using \n credential manager, so ensure that you provide the correct details. The \n workgroup and domain credentials added under the scope of management are \n considered as root account credentials and are automatically stored in \n the credential manager. You are not allowed to delete these root account \n credentials, if needed you can edit or modify them. Similarly you are \n not allowed to delete a credential, if it is used inside the product, \n say for executing a software. Who can add credentials? Users other than administrators with write privileges can also add the \n credentials, by finding credential manager under the settings tab. These \n users do not have the privileges to view or edit the credentials added \n by the administrator and other users.

{"text": "Desktop Central User Management | ManageEngine Role Management Overview Role \n\t Management User-defined Role Pre-defined Roles Defining a Scope User Management Enabling Two Factor \n\t Authentication Points to be Noted Overview As an administrator, many a time you would have felt mundane routines \n spill over crucial attention-seeking jobs of your network. Desktop Central \n answers this concern through its User & Role Management module; delegating \n routine activities to chosen users with well-defined permission levels. \n You can easily administer the users, and define their scope to manage \n a specific set of computers. Role Management Some of the most commonly used Roles are specified under Pre-defined \n Roles. However, you also have the flexibility to define roles that best \n suit your requirements under the User-defined Roles and grant appropriate \n permissions.  Here's a brief on the Pre-defined and User-defined \n roles respectively: User-defined \n Role You can tailor-make any number of roles, \n using Desktop Central and give them permissions of your choice based on \n your personalized needs. These customized roles fall under the User-defined \n category. For a better understanding let us quickly see how to create \n a User-defined Role in the following section. Follow the steps mentioned below to create \n a new User-defined role: 1. Select the Admin tab and click User Administration, under Global \n Settings . This opens the User Administration page. 2. Select the Role tab and click \n the Add Role button. 3. Specify the Role Name and a \n small description about it. 4. You can define module-wise permission level for the Role in the Select \n Control Section. The permission levels are broadly classified into: Full Control - To perform all operations like \n an administrator, for the specific module Write - To perform all the operations, \n except few restrictions as explained below in the table Read - To only view the details in that \n module No Access - To hide the module from the \n User  ( For more details, \n refer to the table below ) 5. Click Add button. You have successfully created \n a new role. The role you have just created will now be available \n\t\t\t in the Roles list of the user creation module. Role deletion \n\t\t\t cannot be performed if that role is associated even with a \n\t\t\t single User. However you can modify the permission levels \n\t\t\t for all User-defined roles. Pre-defined Roles You will find the following roles in the \n Pre-defined category: Administrator Guest Technician Auditor Remote Desktop Viewer IT Asset Manager Patch Manager Mobile Device Manager OS Deployer Administrator Role: The Administrator \n role signifies the Super Admin who exercises full control, on all modules. \n The operations that are listed under the Admin tab include: Defining or modifying Scope of Management Adding Inactive Users Changing mail server settings Changing proxy settings Personalizing options like changing themes, \n\t\t setting session expiry, etc. Scheduling vulnerability database update Scheduling scan settings for Patch Management Editing MSI or Script repository Viewing Actions Logs of Desktop Central Has write permission for the following,  Inventory, \n\t\t Reports, Profiles and Apps in Mobile Device Management. Guest Role: The Guest Role \n retains the Read Only permission to all modules. A user who is associated \n to the Guest Role, will have the privileges to scan and view various information \n about different modules, although making changes is strictly prohibited. \n Guest Role also has Read Only permission for viewing, MDM inventory details, \n reports, profiles and Apps of the mobile devices. Technician Role: The Technician Role has a well defined set of permissions to do specific \n operations. Users under the Technician role are restricted from performing \n all the operations listed under the Admin tab. The operations that can \n be performed by users associated with the Technician Role include: Can define and deploy all types of configurations \n\t\t and collections. Can view all the configurations including \n\t\t those created by other users, reports, etc. Can suspend, modify, or re-deploy the configurations \n\t\t defined by them. Can update the Vulnerability Database. Can perform Scan operations on all modules. Has write permission for the following,  Inventory, \n\t\t Reports, Profiles and Apps in Mobile Device Management. Auditor: The Auditor role is specially \n crafted for Auditing Purposes. This role will help you grant permissions \n to auditors view the details of software inventory, check for license \n compliance, etc. Users with \"Auditor Role\" can also have read \n permission for MDM Reports. Remote Desktop Viewer: The Remote Desktop Viewer Role will allow the users associated with it \n to Invoke a Remote desktop connection and view details of users who had \n connected to a particular system. IT Asset Manager: The IT Asset Manager \n has complete access to the Asset Management module and all the other features \n are inaccessible. IT Asset Manager can also view the Inventory details \n of all the Mobile Devices. Patch \n Manager: The Patch Manager role has complete access to the Patch \n Management. Patch Manager will also have privilege to access to use \"Tools\", \n like Wake On LAN, Remote Shutdown, System Manager and ability to schedule \n Patch Reports. All the other modules/features are inaccessible. Mobile \n Device Manager: Mobile Device Manager \n role has write permission for \n the following,  Inventory, Reports, Profiles and Apps in Mobile Device \n Management. OS Deployer: The OS deployer role provides the associated user the privilege to capture images of Windows OS and deploy it across the network computers. User Roles and Permission Level Defining a Scope Desktop Central provides you the privilege of defining a scope for the \n users, which means you can define the target computers, which can be mapped \n to every user. By limiting the user's permission to specific set of computers, \n you can feel assured that the user has enough permission to perform their \n roles and not excess permission to take unduly advantage. The target that you define as the scope, can be one of the following: All Computers Unique Custom Groups Remote Office All \n Computers When the target is defined as 'All Computers', \n user will have permission to execute all the privileges defined in the \n role, to all the computers. Though the scope is all computers, the permission \n level is determined only by the role, to which the user is mapped. Static \n Unique Groups You can create specific custom groups for \n the management purposes and associate it to the users. The custom groups \n that you create should be Unique, so that no computers can belong to more \n than one custom group. These are computer based custom groups, which are \n created for the user management purpose, is defined as \"scope\" \n for the user. Refer to this to know more about Creating \n Custom Groups Remote \n Office You can create specific remote offices or \n use the existing remote offices to be defined as the scope for the users. \n More than one user can have manage the same remote offices. Similarly \n more than one remote office can be mapped to the same user, however you \n cannot have a combination of remote offices and unique groups as a part \n of the scope. Sharing a Scope More than one user can share the same scope. In such cases, configurations/tasks \n applied to the scope can be managed by more than one user.  To know \n more, refer to this: Points \n to be noted Modifying a \n Scope When a scope of the user is modified,  user will not be able to \n manage the configurations/tasks, which were created by him. He will have \n permission to clone the configurations without the target, so that he \n can re-use them for his current scope. Modifying the computers within \n the scope will not be considered as modifying the scope. 3.User Management Creating \n a User and Associating a Role You can associate a User with a Role while creating a New User. To create \n a user follow the steps mentioned below: Login to Desktop Central client as an Administrator Click User Management link \n\t available under the Global Settings \n\t category Specify the Authentication Type as Active \n\t Directory Authentication or Local \n\t Authentication Specify a User Name, Password \n\t and  Confirm the password The password provided here should adhere by the configured Password Policy under Secure Authentication tab. Specify the Role, from \n\t the drop down. You can see find all the pre-defined roles, and the \n\t  roles that you have created will be listed here Specify the Email address and the Phone number of the user, this is optional Define the Scope for the \n\t user, you can specify the computers, which needs to be managed by \n\t the user. You can choose to provide the user access to manage all \n\t computers, remote offices or specific unique custom groups. If you \n\t do not have a unique custom group, you can create one. If the custom \n\t group is not unique, it will not be listed here. Refer to this, to \n\t know more about : Unique \n\t Custom groups You have successfully create a user and associated a role to the user \n with the scope of the computers that need to be managed. When you opt to authenticate a user via Active Directory, \n\t\t\t the user should have privileges to login to the domain from \n\t\t\t the computer where Desktop Central Server is installed. Modifying \n User details Desktop Central offers the flexibility to modify the role of users, \n to best suit your changing requirements. You can do operations like Changing \n the User Role and Reset User Password at any point of time you feel you \n should. Deleting a User At times when you find a user's contribution obsolete, you can go ahead \n and delete the user from the User List. The user so removed will no more \n exercise Module Permissions. Enabling Two Factor \n Authentication Enabling Two Factor Authentication will secure the access to Desktop \n Central web console. Users will be prompted to enter the One Time Password \n (OTP) along with their default password. You can configure the settings \n to save the OTP for the specific browser. If this option is enabled, user \n will not be prompted for OTP for the number of days, specified here : \n Admin -> User Administration -> Two Factor Authentication. You can \n choose the mode for two factor authentication, which could be via email \n or Google Authenticator. Email One Time password will be sent to the each user via email. You can not \n enable Two Factor Authentication, if one or more users do not have email \n address mapped with Desktop Central server. You will have to ensure that \n email address of all the users are registered in Desktop Central server. When two factor authentication is enabled, users will receive an email \n with the details of the OTP.  Every OTP  is valid for 15 minutes \n from the time of generation. OTP will be an auto-generated 6 digit number. \n You can also allow the users to save the OTP on their web browsers. You \n will have to specify the number of days allowed, for the OTP to be saved \n on the web browser. Users will not be prompted for OTP, if they choose \n to save the OTP on the browser. If you specify the number of days as 0, \n then users will not be allowed to save the OTP on the web browser. OTP \n will be generated every time the user tries to login into Desktop Central \n web console. Google Authenticator You can choose Google Authenticator, to generate OTP.  You will \n have to install Google authenticator on your smart phone. Google authenticator \n can be downloaded based on the mobile device's operating system as mentioned \n below: iOS devices - App \n\t Store Android devices - Google \n\t Play Windows - Windows Store Download and install the authenticator on the mobile device. When you \n can login to Desktop Central web console for the first time,  a QR \n code will be displayed. You will have to open the Google authenticator \n app and scan the QR code to create an account for Desktop Central. You \n can see Desktop Central is now added to the Google authenticator app and \n OTP will be generated automatically. You can use the OTP generated in the google authenticator as the secondary \n authentication and login to Desktop Central. If the user has deleted the Desktop Central account \n\t\t\t on the Google authenticator, then the user should contact \n\t\t\t the administrator to restore Two Factor Authentication using \n\t\t\t Google authenticator. Administrator can re-send the QR Code \n\t\t\t to restore the Google Authenticator from here : Admin -> \n\t\t\t User Management -> Actions (Under the appropriate user) \n\t\t\t -> Re-send QR Code. If the Desktop Central administrator is not able to access Google authenticator, he/she can contact other administrators to send the QR code via e-mail. If there are no other administrators available, then follow the steps given in the document to disable two-factor authentication and then access the server. Password Policy You can impose the following restrictions on passwords for user accounts: Minimum Password Length: Define the minimum length a password should have. Using Previous Passwords: Specify the number of previous passwords that can't be reused. Define Password Complexity: Two options are available:- Simple: Users will be prompted to enter a password that meets the specified password length. There are no enforcements for any characters/numbers to be used. Complex: Users will be prompted to enter a password with minimum one special character(! ~ @ # $ % ^ & + = _ *), upper case and lower case character. Enable User Account Lockout: You can specify the maximum number of invalid login attempts that are allowed before the account gets locked for a customizable 'Lockout duration'. Once a user account has been locked, login is possible only after the lockout duration is over. Points to \n be Noted A Unique Custom group can be managed by more than one user. A same computer cannot be a part of more than one Unique Custom \n\t Group Only Administrators will have permission to modify the scope for \n\t users Scope defined for a user cannot be a combination of custom groups \n\t and remote offices, it can only be  all computers or specific \n\t unique group or remote office When the scope of the user is modified, the user will not be notified \n\t about the changes made to his scope Adding or removing computers from the unique custom groups would \n\t not affect the scope of the user Refer \n\t to the following scenarios and behaviors: User A 's scope : Static Unique Group 1 User B 's scope : Static Unique Group 2 User C 's scope : Static \n\t Unique 2 and Static Unique Group 3 User D 's scope : Static \n\t Unique Group 1, Static Unique Group 2, Static Unique Group 3 and Static \n\t Unique Group 4 User A creates and applies the configuration/task to Static \n\t\t Unique Group 1. This configuration will be visible to User A, \n\t\t and User D, since they share the same scope (Static Unique Group \n\t\t 1). This configuration can be modified by User A and User D. When \n\t\t user D modifies this configuration, the target of this configuration \n\t\t will list only the scope that is being shared by User A and User \n\t\t D. User D creates a configuration and applies it to Static Unique \n\t\t Group 2, then this configuration can be viewed by user User B, \n\t\t User C and User D. All the three users will be able to manage \n\t\t the configuration. User D creates a configuration and applies it to Static Unique \n\t\t Group 3, and Static Unique Group 4. In this case, User C and User \n\t\t D will be able to view this configuration. User C cannot make \n\t\t any changes to  this configuration. User A creates a configuration and applies it to Static Unique \n\t\t Group 1 and later, user A's scope is modified, then this configuration \n\t\t can only be viewed by him, or cloned as a new configuration without \n\t\t the target.

{"text": "Configuring Software Repositories Configuring Software Repositories A software repository is a storage location where you \n can store software packages. You can access these software packages when \n required and install them on computers in your network. In Desktop Central, \n there are two types of software repositories: Network-share \n    repository HTTP repository Network-share Repository A network-share repository is used when you want to \n deploy a software application to multiple computers in a network. It is \n recommended that you store the software package that you want to deploy \n in a network share that is accessible from all the computers in the network. \n The software application will be installed directly in the computers that \n you specify. Most software applications have a single installation \n file like <setup>.exe or the <softwarename>.exe. Other applications \n have more than one installable file, however, these files are located \n in the same directory. Some complex applications, like Microsoft Office, \n have multiple installable files. Here each installable file is located \n in a different directory. It is recommended that you deploy such applications \n from a network share that is accessible from all the computers in your \n network. Advantages Using a network-share repository enables you to do the \n following: Ensure that you do not have multiple copies of the \n same software application in your network Fill the details of your network-share repository \n automatically whenever you add a package Save your network bandwidth as executable files are \n not copied into the computers Required \n Permissions The network-share repository should have the Read and Execute permission for all \n the users and computers in the network. You should set the permissions \n mentioned above for the group Everyone . \n This ensures that the network-share repository is accessible from all \n the computers in the network. However, ensure that you do not set the permissions \n to Read and Execute for all the users and computers in the network when \n you want to do the following: Restrict \n    certain users from accessing the network-share repository directly Deploy \n    a software application to users or computers across multiple domains or \n    workgroups. For example, assume that your network-share repository is in domain \n    A and you deploy a software application from this repository to a computer \n    in domain B. You should ensure that you do not set the permissions to \n    Read and Execute for all the users and computers in the network. In such cases, you can provide user credentials that have the Read \n      and Execute access to the network-share repository in which the software \n    package is stored. Desktop Central will use these credentials to access \n    the repository and deploy the software. Top Creating \n a Network-share Repository To create a network-share repository, follow the steps \n given below: Click the Software \n    Deployment tab In the Settings section, click Software Repository Click the Create \n    a Network Share option Enter the path for the \n    network share If you do not enter a path for the network share, it will automatically be created in the computer where Desktop Central server is installed. Check the Accessing \n the Share using Credentials checkbox Enter a username and \n password a. If you are creating the network share on a domain computer, prefix the domain name to the username. For example, ZohoCorp\\Administrator. b. If you are creating the network share on a workgroup computer, prefix the computer name to the username. For example, \\DCAdmin. Click Save You have created a network-share repository. Top HTTP Repository An HTTP repository is used to store executable files \n before you install them in computers in your network. You can use this \n repository when you want to deploy software packages to computers using \n the HTTP path. You can also change the location of the HTTP repository \n if required. The HTTP repository is created automatically when you \n install Desktop Central. It is located in the same folder as the Desktop \n Central server. For example, <Desktop Central server>\\webapps\\DesktopCentral\\swrepository. \n You can change the location \n of the repository if required. Advantages Using an HTTP repository enables you to do the following: Install \n    software applications in computers that do not have access to a network-share \n    repository Access \n    computers when the computers are unable to access a network-share repository \n    because the required number of connections have been reached Do not \n    have to set any permissions when using an HTTP repository Changing \n the Location of the HTTP Repository To change the location of the HTTP repository, follow \n the steps given below: Click the Software \n    Deployment tab In the Settings section, click Software Repository Click the HTTP \n    Repository tab Enter the path of the \n    new location Click Save You have changed the location of the HTTP \n  repository. If you are unable to change the location of the HTTP repository, \n  see Cannot Change the Location of the HTTP Repository Top Network Share VS. HTTP Upload While it is recommended that you have a common software \n repository, it is not mandatory. You also have an option to upload the \n executable files in the Desktop Central server from where they are copied \n into the computers before being deployed. Using this approach will increase \n your bandwidth overhead as the executable files are copied into each of \n the computers. Therefore, it is recommended that you use this approach \n when you are deploying software applications to computers in a remote \n location. This is because, in most cases, when you deploy software applications \n to computers in remote locations you do not have access to the respective \n network-share repository. When you want to deploy software packages to computers \n in a LAN and WAN, create two packages for the same software application. \n Store one set of packages in the network-share repository. These will \n be deployed and installed in the computers in the LAN. Store the other \n set of packages in the HTTP repository. These will be uploaded and deployed \n to the computers in the WAN. When you want to install multiple packages you can zip \n them and upload. For more information, see How \n to use the HTTP Path option to deploy software packages that have multiple \n executable files in different directory structures? There are a few exceptional scenarios where executable \n files are copied to computers in your network when using network-share \n repository. This can happen when you do the following: Choose \n    the Copy Files/Folders option \n    while defining a configuration to install software applications Are required \n    to use user credentials to access the network-share repository Use the Run As option while installing \n    software packages as a user, other than the administrator Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp .

{"text": "Adding a Domain/Workgroup | ManageEngine Desktop Central Data backup is your most important task - Why? Corporate data is invaluable and it will cost you time and effort to recreate it. Backups are a way to protect the investment in data. If you are responsible for business-critical data, a loss may involve financial or customer data. If the data is on a personal computer, you could lose other salient files that would be hard to replace. Desktop Central lets you configure folder backup to all the computers in your network, so that you don't have to run them manually.  Adopt the most important cyber hygiene practice with Desktop Central . Steps Navigate to Windows Configurations from Configurations tab. Create a Folder Backup configuration by furnishing the following details : Name & description for the configuration File path to the source folder - This is the folder that needs to be backed up. The source folder should be present in the client computer where Desktop Central agent is installed. File path to the destination folder - This is the folder where the backup would be stored. This destination folder needs to be a share folder. If you want to secure the backup of your data, as an administrator, you can provide the credentials for accessing the destination folder . Taking this a step further, configure advanced settings - You can choose to either include or exclude the hidden files, hidden folders and the sub folders . Decide on the maximum permissible file size - could be in MB or GB. True to its name, Advanced Settings lets you exclude specific files and folders . You could add more files/folders if required. Define the target and execution settings. Folder backup configuration Note : Once deployed, this configuration will be executed continuously until suspended or moved to trash. This implies that, till such time when the deployed configuration is either suspended or deleted, a backup of your source folder will be created dynamically and continuously. In order to track the offline changes, at least one change needs to be performed when the endpoint is back in the network. This differential data will be backed up as soon as the endpoint joins the network. You have successfully created a folder backup configuration using Desktop Central. Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp .

{"text": "Manage SSL Certificate | ManageEngine Desktop Central Securing Communication using 3rd Party Certificates Every Enterprise has the necessity to encrypt the data which traverses\nthe internet. Using secured communication has not proved to be the most\nsecure way to transmit corporate data, so enterprises have gone a step\nahead to get specific third party certificates like SSL, PFX etc. These\nthird party certificates ensures that the corporate data is encrypted\nin such a way, that only the recipient who owns the certificate can decrypt\nit. Desktop Central supports using SSL and PFX certificates. Adding these\ncertificates to Desktop Central will secure the communication between\nthe Desktop Central server, managed computers and mobile devices. This certificate is valid for a specified\nterm. If the certificate expires, then the communication between\nthe Desktop Central agent and the server will no longer be secure. You will not be able to manage\nany mobile devices, till you renew the certificates and upload\nit in the Desktop Central server. Follow the steps mentioned below to create/renew and upload 3rd Party\nCertificates: Create CSR and Key Files Submit the CSR to a Certificate\nAuthority (CA) to Obtain a CA Signed Certificate Upload\nthe 3rd party Certificates to Desktop Central 1.

{"text": "Managing Computers of Roaming users using Desktop Central | ManageEngine Managing Computers of Roaming users The job of an IT administrator gets more challenging when it comes in \n managing computers of their sales and marketing teams. Users of these \n teams tend to roam around regularly, thus keeping their computers in track \n turns out to be a difficult job. In these scenarios, possibilities are \n high for computers to move from one remote office to another on regular \n basis. Desktop Central has different agents for different locations, for \n example a local office agent will not be the same as the remote office \n agent. Similarly each remote office has different agents as well. To make \n your management easier, you can have a defined set of IP ranges for different \n offices. This enables the Desktop Central Server to identify the agents \n with respect to the IP range. With Desktop Central you can manage computers \n of users who move between remote offices, as well as those who access \n the Desktop Central server via internet. Users who move \n between remote offices When your users will roam only within the remote offices, \n you can add an IP scope and manage their computers. So whenever a computer \n or laptop is moving from a local office to a remote location, a new IP \n address is automatically assigned to that computer or laptop by the DHCP \n server in the remote office network. The Desktop Central agent then determines \n whether the new IP address, that was assigned, is within the IP range \n of the new remote office. When a change is detected, the respective remote \n office agent is deployed automatically. Thus IP \n scope is used to automatically detect and deploy the respective \n WAN agent. Follow the below steps to add an IP scope, Under SoM , Click the IP Scope tab Click Add \n\t Scope In the Select \n\t Remote Office list, select the required remote office name Select either of the following \n\t types of IP Scope: IP \n\t\t Address Range : Enter the start and end IP addresses Subnet : \n\t\t Enter the subnet mask and subnet IP address Click Save You have successfully configured IP scope. If there is a rare chance of computers movement across remote \n\t\t office, instead of defining the IP scope, you can move these computers \n\t\t using the Move to option \n\t\t available in Computers tab under SoM . Users \n who access Desktop Central server via internet Users who tend to travel apart from the remote offices like sales and \n marketing executives tend to access Desktop Central server via internet. \n For these users,  you can configure a default remote office, such \n that if a user does not fall under the IP scope of any remote office, \n they will be automatically assigned to the default remote office. Default \n remote office works only if IP Scope is configured for other local office \n or a remote office. Follow the below steps to configure \"Default \n Remote Office\" Under SoM , \n\t click IP Scope tab Click Configure Default \n\t Remote Office Enable the check box to Enable \n\t Default Remote Office. From the drop down select the remote office/local office which \n\t needs to be set as default. Click Save to save changes. Thus managing computers of roaming users is made easier.

{"text": "Managing Computers in WAN using Desktop Central | ManageEngine Managing Computers in Wide Area Networks (WAN) With rapid increase in globalization, most companies \n have their branch offices spread across different places of the world. \n Managing the computers in these branch offices effectively is always a \n tedious job for the system administrators. With Desktop Central in hand, \n managing computers in WAN across remote office will turn out to be a much \n easier process. To manage computers in a remote location you have to add \n remote offices. You can add and modify the remote offices according to \n your requirement. Communication across these remote offices is possible \n by two ways Through Distribution Server Direct communication with Desktop Central \n\t server When to use distribution server? Distribution server acts as a communication layer \n between your remote office computers and the Desktop Central server. It \n replicates the software and patch binaries from the Desktop Central server \n and gives it to the computers in that remote office. The remote office \n computers, instead of getting the patch and software binaries individually \n from the Desktop Central server, gets it from the Distribution server, \n thus saving your WAN bandwidth. So, it is ideal to use a Distribution \n Server, if you have a limited WAN bandwidth and if you can afford to keep \n one computer which should be always running, to serve the purpose of Distribution \n server. We recommend Distribution server when you manage more than 10 \n computers in your remote office. When to use direct communication? When you choose your communication type as Direct \n communication, all the remote office computers will get the required data \n from the Desktop Central server directly. You can use this option, if \n you have limited computers in your remote office, say less than 10, or \n if you do not have any bandwidth limitation. Adding a remote office For managing computers in WAN you have to add a remote \n office. You can add the remote office directly by selecting the Remote offices tab and clicking Add Remote office . The following \n points are needed to be taken care while adding a remote office. As discussed above, decide on the communication \n\t type you wish to choose while adding a remote office. Either Through Distribution server or Direct communication . If you choose the communication type Through Distribution server , it \n\t is recommended that you have a dedicated computer for your distribution \n\t server and this computer should have static IP address for hassle \n\t free communication between the remote office computers and the distribution \n\t server. Select a Replication Policy that meets your need and associate it with the remote office to optimize your bandwidth utilization while transferring large binaries from Desktop Central server to Distribution Server. Know more on Replication Policy and its significance here To install Distribution server and WAN agents \n\t automatically, under Remote office \n\t agent Installation section, ensure that you specify the Domain credentials with administrator \n\t privileges to all the computers managed in the remote office. You can add the computers to be managed either \n\t directly by clicking the Add computers option, or by importing a CSV \n\t file. For adding multiple computers, the CSV file should contain computer \n\t name given in separate lines. Adding Multiple Remote offices You can also add the remote office by importing a CSV file. For adding \n multiple remote offices, the CSV file should contain remote office names \n given in separate lines. Modifying a remote office You can also modify the remote office, by clicking the Modify icon, under the Actions column against the remote office you want to modify. If you have modified \n the communication type from Direct communication to Through Distribution server , you have \n to install a Distribution server to manage that remote office.

Enterprises \n sync their Patch Database with the Desktop Central Patch Repository to \n ensure that their database is up-to-date. All the machines are scanned \n for the missing patches, only based on the Patch Database.  Configuring \n the Patch Database Settings, refers to the time interval during which \n the Patch Database will sync the patch details from the Desktop Central's \n Patch Repository. Administrators can choose to use patch management for patching a specific \n type of Patch like, OS related patches or third party patches etc. Though \n there could be a lot of patches released frequently, not every enterprise \n will have a need to update all those patches to all the computers. So, \n Administrators use the \" Decline \n Patch \" feature.

Then computers will be scanned to identify \n the missing patches related to \"Mac, Linux and 3rd party patches \n related to windows operating system\". To configure the Patch Database settings, follow the steps below: Click the Admin tab to invoke the Admin page. Click the Patch \n\t Settings -> Patch Database Settings icon Select the type of Patches that you wish to manage, \n\t like Microsoft, Apple or 3rd Party Patches. If you wanted to update \n\t only Microsoft patches or 3rd party patches for Windows Operating \n\t System, you can specify it here. This provides you the feasibility \n\t to customize Patch Management, based on your requirement. You select \n\t only Microsoft Patches, however the patch database will get all the \n\t updates from the Desktop Central's Patch Repository.

{"text": "How Desktop Central Works? | ManageEngine How Desktop Central Works? ManageEngine Desktop Central is a Web-Based windows desktop administration\n software that helps administrators to effectively manage the desktops \n from a central point. It provides Configurations, Inventory Management, \n Patch Management, Service Pack Installation, Software Installation, Desktop \n Sharing, System Tools, Active Directory Reports and User Logon Report. Desktop \n\t Central LAN Architecture Desktop \n\t Central WAN Architecture Desktop \n Central LAN Architecture The figure below depicts the Desktop Central Architecture. The details \n of the individual components are given below: Fig: Desktop Central \n Architecture for LAN Server Component Desktop Central Server is located at the enterprise (customer site) \n is responsible for performing various Desktop Management activities. It \n pushes the Desktop Central agent to the client machines, deploys configurations, \n initiates scanning for Inventory and Patch Management, and generates reports \n of the Active Directory Infrastructure Components to effectively manage \n the desktops in the enterprise network. It is advised to keep the Desktop \n Central server always running to carry out the day-to-day Desktop Management \n activities. All these actions can be initiated from a web-based administration \n console in a few simple clicks. Agent Component Desktop Central Agent is light-weight software that gets installed in \n the client systems that are being managed using Desktop Central. It acts \n as a worker to carry out the operations as instructed by the Desktop Central \n Server. It is also responsible for updating the Desktop Central Server \n with the status of the deployed configurations. The agent periodically pulls the instructions from the Desktop Central Server \n and executes the tasks. The agent contacts the server at the following \n intervals: For user-specific configurations - during user \n\t logon and every 90 minutes thereafter till the user logs out of the \n\t computer. For computer-specific configurations - during system \n\t startup and every 90 minutes thereafter till the system is shutdown. Patch Database The Patch Database is a portal in the ManageEngine site, which hosts \n the latest vulnerability database that has been published after a thorough \n testing. The Desktop Central Server periodically synchronizes this information \n and scans the systems in the enterprise site to determine the missing \n patches. Subsequently, the patches are installed to fix the vulnerabilities. The communication between the Desktop Central Server and the Patch Database \n is through the Proxy Server or a direct connection to internet. The required \n patches will be downloaded from Microsoft website and stored locally in \n the Desktop Central Server before deploying the patches to the client \n computers. Hence, each client computer (agent) will take the patch binaries \n from the Desktop Central Server. Web Console Provides a central control point for all the desktop \n\t management functions. Can be accessed from anywhere: LAN, Remote Offices, \n\t and Home through Internet/VPN. No separate client installations are required. Active Directory For Active Directory based Domain setup, the Desktop Central Server \n queries the Active Directory to generate out-of-the-box reports for Sites, \n Domains, Organization Units, Groups, Computers, etc., which gives you \n a complete visibility into the Active Directory. Port Details Ports to be opened on the Agent To enable remote installation of the Agent, \n you should open these ports, these ports may not be required post agent \n installation. 135 : Used to enable remote administration. 139 & 445 : Used to enable sharing \n\t of files and printers. Ports to be opened on the Server 8020: Used for agent-server communication \n\t and to access the Web console 8383: Used for secured communication \n\t between the agent and the Desktop Central server 8443: Used for the Remote Control \n\t feature with secured communication 8444: Used for the Remote Control \n\t feature 8031: Used to transfer files in a \n\t secure mode while accessing a remote computer using Remote Control 8032: Used to transfer files while \n\t accessing a remote computer using Remote Control 8027: Used to complete on-demand \n\t tasks like inventory scanning, patch scanning, remote control, remote \n\t shutdown and moving agents from one remote office to another Desktop \n Central WAN Architecture Desktop Central supports managing Computers in a distributed setup like \n branch/remote offices and for mobile users (eg. Sales Persons). The figure \n below depicts the Desktop Central Architecture for managing computers \n in WAN. The details of the individual components are given below: Fig: Desktop \n Central WAN Architecture Advantages Simple, fast, and an affordable solution for your \n\t desktop management needs. Low bandwidth utilization Network-neutral desktop management. No separate VPN infrastructure is required. Secured communication between the Server and the Agent. Centralized management of computers from a single \n\t console. Server Component Desktop Central Server has to be installed in your LAN (say, the head \n office) and has to be configured as an EDGE device. This means that the \n designated port (default being 8020 and is configurable) should be accessible \n through Internet. You need to adopt necessary security standards to harden \n the OS where the Desktop Central Server is installed.  Agents from \n all the remote locations report to this Desktop Central Server. The Server acts as a container to store the configuration details and, \n upon request, provide the instructions to the agents. It is advised to \n keep the Desktop Central server always running to carry out the day-to-day \n Desktop Management activities. Distribution Server Component Desktop Central Distribution Server is light-weight software that is \n installed in one of the computers in the Branch Offices. This agent will \n communicate with the Desktop Central Server to pull the information for \n all the computers in that branch. The agents that reside in the branch \n office computers will contact the Distribution Server to get the information \n available to them and process the requests. Low bandwidth utilization as only one agent will contact \n\t the Server periodically Pulls the configuration details, software packages, \n\t patches to be installed, etc., from the Desktop Central Server and \n\t makes it available for the rest of the computers in the branch. Supports secured mode of communication (SSL/HTTPS) \n\t with the Server. Distribution Server installation is one-time and subsequent \n\t upgrades will be automatically performed. Agent Component Desktop Central Agent is light-weight software that is installed in \n the client systems that are being managed using Desktop Central. It acts \n as a worker to carry out the operations as instructed by the Desktop Central \n Server. Unobtrusive light-weight component. Can either be installed manually or through the logon \n\t script in all the computers that are being managed using Desktop Central. \n\t However, for computers in the local LAN, the agents will be automatically \n\t installed. Agent installation is one-time and subsequent upgrades \n\t will be automatically performed. For computers in the same LAN as that of the Desktop \n\t Central Server, the agent will periodically connect to the Server \n\t to PULL the configurations available for them, deploys them and updates \n\t the status back to the Server. For computers in Branch Offices, the agent will contact \n\t the Master Agent to PULL the configurations available for them, deploys \n\t them and updates the status back to the Server. Web Console Provides a central control point for all the desktop \n\t management functions. Can be accessed from anywhere: LAN, Remote Offices, \n\t and Home through Internet/VPN.

{"text": "Block Executable | ManageEngine Desktop Central Block Executable One of the most challenging task in system administration is to restrict \n usage of certain applications. Desktop Central facilitates you to perform \n this task at ease. You will be able to block the required applications/executable \n using this feature. You can apply these restrictions for specific computers. \n Desktop Central's prohibited \n software helps you to uninstall the software applications which are \n not allowed in the network. Block executable feature, allows you to restrict \n the executable when it is launched, on the target computers. You can block \n even executable like, notepad.exe, putty.exe etc which are launched without \n being installed on the target computer. All the file formats supported \n under  Windows \"Software Restriction Policy\" can be blocked \n using Desktop Central. There are two ways to block an application/executable, \n they are: Blocking using Path Rule Blocking using Hash Value The following prerequisites should be met for blocking the \n\t\t executable Local Group Policy should be \n\t\t\t enabled on the target machine Local Group Policy Should be \n\t\t\t enabled on the target computer Default security Policy should \n\t\t\t be set as \"Unrestricted\" Local Group Policy should be enabled for Administrator Blocking using Path Rule You can choose this option to create a policy in order to block an executable. \n Path Rule, is used to block an executable based on the name of the executable \n and its extension. If the user, renames the application then the application \n will not be recognized, which means the application will not be blocked. \n You can use this rule, if  you wanted to block applications even \n if they are not available in your network. All you need to know is just \n the name of the executable and its file extension. Using path rule, blocks \n all the versions of the specified application.   For example, \n if you have created a path rule to block Google Chrome browser for a specific \n version, say version 44.0. This policy will block all the versions of \n Google Chrome browser, unless the executable is not renamed. Blocking using Hash Value Hash is a unique value, that represents the executable. If you choose \n to block an executable using the hash value, then it will be blocked even \n if renamed. If you wanted to block an executable using hash value, you \n should locate it on the server, for the hash value can be calculated. Creating a Policy If you wanted to block an executable to a specific target, then you \n will have to create a policy. Selecting the target computers is the first \n step in creating a policy. You will have to select the executable which \n needs to be blocked, if it exists in the database. If you wanted to block \n an executable for the first time, then you will have to add the executable \n and choose to block rule as path or hash. You can create two different \n policies for a single executable, one using path and the other using hash \n value. Policy will be applied on the target computer for the first time, \n after the system restart. Blocking Executable for All the Computers Desktop Central by default has a custom group, which contains all the \n managed computers. If you wanted to block an executable for all the managed \n computers, then you can choose \"All Managed Computers\" group \n and select the executable, which needs to be blocked. You will have to \n create a policy by specifying the target and executable which needs to \n be blocked. Blocking Executable for Specific Users/Computers To block an executable for specific target, you will have to create \n a new custom group or use the existing custom groups. Custom groups can \n be of any type such as, unique or static. You can block executable by \n choosing custom group which contains users or computers. \"Block executable\" does not support blocking executable \n\t\t which are initiated by the system. Troubleshooting Tips: How to enable Local Group Policy on \n\t the target machine? You will have to perform the following steps manually on the target \n\t computer: Go to Run Type gpedit.msc Click Group Policy Click on \" Turn \n\t\t Off Local Group Policy Objects Processing \" as shown \n\t\t below. Ensure that you have chosen \n\t\t \"Not Configured\" as shown in the below image. You have now enabled Local Group Policy on the target machine. How to enable Local Group Policy \n\t on the target computer? You will have to perform the following steps manually on the target \n\t computer: Go to Run Type gpedit.msc Right Click on \" Local \n\t\t Computer Policy \", Choose Properties to ensure that \"Disable Computer Configuration \n\t\t Settings\" is not selected. You have now enabled Local Group Policy on the target computer. How to set the Default security Policy \n\t as \"Unrestricted\" You will have to perform the following steps manually on the target \n\t computer: Go to Run Type gpedit.msc Click \"Security Levels\" and double click \"Unrestricted\" \n\t\t as shown below Ensure that the status is set as \"Default\" as mentioned \n\t\t in the image below. You have now enabled Local Group Policy on the target computer. How to enable Local Group Policy for the Administrator? You will have to perform the following steps manually on the target \n\t computer: Go to Run Type gpedit.msc Click \"Software \n\t\t Restriction Policy\" Double click \"Enforcement\" to ensure that \" All \n\t\t Users\" is selected as shown in the image below You have now enabled Local Group Policy for Administrators.

The following details are to be taken into consideration while adding rules: File name * : This refers to the executable file name of a software application. You can get this information from the Version/Details tab in the Properties page of the executable file. Original file name : In most cases, the original file name is the same as the name of the executable file. If a user has renamed the executable file of a software application, you can track the usage of that software application, based on its original file name.You can get this information from the Version tab in the Properties page of the executable file. If this information is not available, you can leave the text field blank. Product name : This refers to the name of the product exclusive of the version number. File version : This refers to the version of the executable file of a software application. If you want the agent to gather details about specific file versions, use an asterisk in the File Version box. For example, if you want the agent to gather details about all file versions beginning with 9, enter 9.* in the File Version box. You can get this information from the Version tab in the Properties page of the executable file. If this information is not available, you can leave the text field blank. If the text field is left blank, the usage details of all the versions of a particular software used in the network will be metered. To find information about the above mentioned details, follow \n the steps given below: Assume \n\t\t that you want to find information about the details of Cliq software. Open the exe file location of the required software in windows explorer. For this, you will have to open the shortcut location of the software and right click on properties. Right click on the exe file to obtain details such as file version, original file name and product name. Figure \n 1: Shortcut in Windows Explorer Figure \n 2: File version Figure \n 3: Original file name Figure \n 4: Product name You now have the required information to add rules. Adding Rules You are required to add rules to monitor the usage \n details of specific software applications. To add rules, follow the steps \n given below: Under Inventory tab, click on Software metering from the left tree. After clicking on Add Rules ,  provide mandatory details such as Software name, Rule name and File name. The \n\t\t name you enter for the rule should be unique and descriptive. \n\t\t For example, if you have selected Adobe Flash Player, you can \n\t\t enter Monitoring Adobe Flash Player Usage as the name of the rule. \n\t\t Once you have used this name, you cannot use it as a name for \n\t\t any other rule. You \n\t\t cannot add software metering rules for groups of software. Software metering reports There are three types of software metering reports that help you make an informed decision about buying software applications and renewing licenses for existing software applications. The reports are as follows: Software metering rules summary Computers with metered software Users with metered software Software metering rules summary Based on the rules added for metering of a particular software, this report provides the following details : Discovered count : Number of computers in the network which have the software application installed. This will be updated only after the software is used in the client machine. Usage count : Number of times a software application is used in all the computers in the network. Usage duration : Information about how long a software application has been used. Computers with metered software It provides the software usage details such as usage count and usage duration for a particular software application on each computer. In addition to this, the admin can view the reports for each computer during a stipulated time period. With the help of such usage details, the admin can choose to either retain or revoke the license for the software application used on each computer. Users with metered software The usage details for every user specific software is provided in this report. This is helpful when the users logs into several computer but still the software usage details for that user-specific software needs to be metered.

{"text": "Data Backup and Restore Data Back up and Restore Desktop Central stores information like configuration \n details, status of deployed configurations, and details about reports, \n like User Logon reports and Active Directory reports, in a database. Creating \n a backup of this database and certain important files like configuration \n files is necessary to prevent loss of data. You can back up data automatically, by scheduling \n a back up using Desktop Central, or taking a back up manually. You can \n also restore this data when required. For example, assume that your hard \n disk crashes and you have to re-install Desktop Central. You can use the \n last back up you took to restore all the required information. Note that \n this is possible only if the backup file is stored in a computer other \n than yours. Best Practises for Back up and restore These are \n the few best practices recommended for Back Up and Restore option. Make sure that you add \n\t the exclusion list for Anti Virus. When directories containing the \n\t  MySQL / PGSQL data are scanned by anti virus software, they \n\t misidentify the files content as spam and does not allow to back up \n\t that data. Refer the following links which will guide you, how to \n\t exclude the Anti Virus. McAffe : https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB50998 Symantec : http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH99955 Kaspersky : http://support.kaspersky.com/us/faq/?qid=208284276 It is always recommended to Schedule the \n\t  back up during non-office hours. Make sure that you have a minimum of  5GB \n\t space to store the back up data. Make sure that you specify a Valid destination \n\t folder. Make sure that the remote database if configured, \n\t should be running during back up. Scheduling Data Backup You can use Desktop Central to take a back up of the database regularly. \n For example, if you want to take a back up of the database every Friday \n at 5 p.m., you can schedule the same using Desktop Central. To schedule back up of \n data, follow the steps given below: Select the Admin tab Under Database settings click Database Backup Specify the time at which \n\t you want the back up to be taken, in hour:minute:second (hh:mm:ss) \n\t format The time should be specified in the 24-hour format. \n\t\t\t For example, if you want the database back up to be taken \n\t\t\t at 6 p.m., the time should be specified as 18:00:00. Select the number of backup \n\t files that you want Desktop Central to save Using this option you \n\t\t\t can select how many database backup files should be saved. \n\t\t\t The older backup files will be deleted. For example, if you \n\t\t\t want only 7 backup files saved, select 7. This will ensure \n\t\t\t that at all times only 7 backup files are saved. Specify the location where \n\t you want the backup files to be stored Check the Notify \n\t when the database backup fails checkbox Specify the email address \n\t (es) to which you want an e-mail message sent, if the database back \n\t up failslease note that you should have configured your mail server \n\t settings to get notified. Ensure that you \n\t\t\t have configured your mail server settings to receive notifications. Click Save \n\t Changes You have scheduled an \n automatic data backup to take place automatically at a specified time. Manual Data Backup and Restore You can manually back up and restore the database. You can do this using \n the Backup-Restore Utility GUI. Opening the Backup-Restore Utility Graphical User \n Interface (GUI) To open the Backup-Restore Utility GUI, follow the steps given below: Right click start -->Explore --> directory where DC server folder is present -->bin For example, right click start -->Explore -->Local \n\t Disk (C:) -->Program Files -->DesktopCentral_Server -->bin Double-click backuprestore.bat You've opened the Backup-Restore Utility GUI. Creating a backup file On the Backup-Restore Utility \n\t GUI, click the Backup tab Select the location where \n\t you want to save the backup file If \n\t\t\t you're using a network share, the directory should have write \n\t\t\t permission for everyone in the network. Click Backup You can choose to encrypt the backup file by providing a password. A backup file is created and saved in the \n specified location. The file will be named using the buildnumber-date-time.zip \n format. For example, 70120-Oct-25-2010-13-26.zip where 70120 is the build \n number, Oct 25th 2010 is the date and 13:26 is the time. Restoring a backup file Ensure \n\t\t\t that you have shut down the Desktop Central server before \n\t\t\t restoring a backup file. On the Backup-Restore Utility \n\t GUI, click the Restore tab Browse and select the required \n\t backup file. Click Restore In case you have opted for encrypting the backup file, you will have to provide the password for restoring the backup. The build number of the \n\t\t\t Desktop Central server should match the build number of the \n\t\t\t backup file you are restoring. Ensure that you choose the \n\t\t\t correct architecture of the Desktop Central installation, \n\t\t\t such as 32-bit or 64-bit. You can verify the details by viewing \n\t\t\t the Support tab, on the Desktop Central web console. This will restore the specified data to Desktop \n Central server. If \n\t\t remote database is configured with the Desktop Central server, \n\t\t ensure that it is running on a remote machine. After restoration, \n\t\t the changes made after the backup date will not be available. Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp . All Rights Reserved. ManageEngine"}

What does \"Not Applicable\" \n in the Execution Status view indicate? When a configuration is applied using Desktop Central, the total target \n count, irrespective of whether the exclude criteria is defined or not, \n is shown as Total Target Computers in the Execution Status view . This \n is because, the number of desktops that falls under the exclude category \n can only be determined at the time of deployment in the client machines. \n This count is later included in the Not Applicable category to match the \n count. For configurations that do not have an exclude criteria, the Not Applicable \ncount will be zero. Questions 15. What is the significance \n of the \"Update Now\" button shown in Report page? The details about the Active Directory are periodically fetched and \n stored in the database. Any modifications in the Active Directory will \n not be reflected in the report immediately as the update is only periodic. \n To synchronize the data, click the Update Now button. Questions 16. Will the inactive users \n be refreshed automatically? Inactive user entries will be refreshed automatically whenever the Active \n Directory contents are getting updated in Desktop Central's local database. \n Also the inactive user state will be made as active if any configuration, \n excluding Windows Installer, Alert, and Custom Script configurations, \n is applied for an inactive user. Questions 17. I have uninstalled the \n Product, but the agents installed by Desktop Central are not uninstalled. \n How to uninstall all the agents now?

Site One or more well connected (highly reliable and fast) TCP/IP subnets.\n A site allows administrators to configure Active Directory access and\n replication topology quickly and easily to take advantage of the physical\n network. When users log on, Active Directory clients locate Active Directory\n servers in the same site as the user. Domain Domain is a group of computers that are part of a network and share\n a common directory database. A domain is administered as a unit with common\n rules and procedures. Each domain has a unique name. Organizational Unit (OU) An organizational unit is a logical container into which users, groups,\n computers, and other organizational units are placed. It can contain objects\n only from its parent domain. An organizational unit is the smallest scope\n to which a Group Policy object can be linked, or over which administrative\n authority can be delegated. Top Group A collection of users, computers, contacts,\n and other groups. Groups can be used as security or as e-mail distribution\n collections. Distribution groups are used only for e-mail. Security groups\n are used both to grant access to resources and as e-mail distribution\n lists. User The people using the workstations in the network are called users. Each\n user in the network has a unique user name and corresponding password\n for secured access. Computer The PCs in the network which are accessed by users are known as computer\n or workstation. Each computer has unique name. IP Address The expansion of IP Address is Internet Protocol Address. An unique\n IP Address is provided for each workstation, switches, printers, and other\n devices present in the network for identification and routing of information. Group Policy Object (GPO) A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a collection of settings that define\n what a system will look like and how it will behave for a defined group\n of users. Client Side Extension (CSE) Desktop Central installs an Windows-compliant agent or a Client Side\n Extension (CSE) in the machines that are being managed. This is used to\n get the status of the applied configurations from the targets. Define Target Define Target is the process of identifying the users or computers for\n which the configuration have to be applied. The targets can be all users/computers\n belonging to a Site, Domain, OUs, Groups, or can be a specific user/computer.\n You also have an option to exclude some desktops based on the machine\n type, OS type, etc. Scope of Management Scope of Management (SOM) is used to define the computers that have\n to be managed using this software. Initially the administrator can define\n a small set of computers for testing the software and later extend it\n to the whole domain. This provides more flexibility in managing your desktops\n using this software. Inactive Users In a Windows Domain there may be cases where the user accounts have been\n created for some machines but they remain inactive for some reasons. For\n example, users like Guest, IUSER_WIN2KMASTER, IWAM_WIN2KMASTER, etc.,\n will never login. These user accounts are referred to as Inactive Users.\n In order to get the accurate configuration status of the active users,\n it is recommended that the Admin User add the inactive user accounts in\n their domain so that these users (user accounts) may not be considered\n for calculating the status. Collection Configurations that are intended for the same set of targets can be\n grouped as a collection. Applicable Patches This is a subset of the patches released by Microsoft that affect your\n network systems / applications. This includes all the patches affecting\n your network irrespective of whether they are installed or not. Missing Patches This refers to the patches affecting your network that are not installed. Latest Patches This refers to the patches pertaining to the recently released Microsoft\n bulletins.

Informational Patches There maybe some vulnerabilities for which Desktop Central is not able\n to determine if the appropriate patch or work around has been applied.\n There could also be patches for which manual intervention is required.\n These are categorized as Informational Items. Remediation of these issues\n usually involves a configuration change or work around rather than a patch. Obsolete Patches These are patches that are outdated and have another patch that is more\n recently released and has taken its place (Superseding Patch). If these\n patches are missing, you can safely ignore them and deploy the patches\n that supersede them. Top Some definitions are adapted from Microsoft Help Documentation."}

{"text": "Disk Defragmenter Disk Defragmenter Tool Adapted from Windows Help Documentation Volumes become fragmented as users create and delete files and folders, \n install new software, or download files from the Internet. Computers typically \n save files in the first contiguous free space that is large enough for \n the file. If a large enough free space is not available, the computer \n saves as much of the file as possible in the largest available space and \n then saves the remaining data in the next available free space, and so \n on. After a large portion of a volume has been used for file and folder \n storage, most of the new files are saved in pieces across the volume. \n When you delete files, the empty spaces left behind fill in randomly as \nyou store new ones. The more fragmented the volume is, the slower the computer's file input/output \nperformance will be.

{"text": "Exclude Patch Applications | ManageEngine Desktop Central Decline Patches Overview Declining Patch, is an important part of patch deployment. When we automate \n patch management, all the missing patches are downloaded and deployed \n to the target computers. This results in deploying patches even though, \n they might not be business critical. So, you will have to choose to ignore \n patches which are not critical. Ignoring to install some of missing patches \n will reflect on the system's health status. Computers in your network \n might be rated as highly vulnerable, or Vulnerable. In order to avoid this, you can decline patches. Declining a patch results \n in the following: When a patch is declined, it will not be considered as missing \n\t patch It will not be calculated for the system health status Patches that are declined will not be deployed via automated patch \n\t deployment. Declining Patches to All Computers \n or Specific Group You can choose to decline specific patches or all patches pertaining \n to a specific application. Patches can be declined to all computers or \n specific group of computers.  A default group named, \"All Computers Group\" is created by  Desktop Central. If you wanted to decline a specific \n patch to all computers, then you can choose this group and decline the \n required patches. If you want some of the patches to be declined to a \n specific group of computers, then you can create separate custom groups \n like, groups based on OS, or Remote Office, etc. and decline the  patches. Here are few examples for of how decline patch works: Assume a specific patch \"Adobe \n\t 1.1\" has been declined for a All \n\t computers Group , then the patch \"Adobe \n\t 1.1\" , will not be considered as missing patch and will \n\t not be downloaded in the network. Computers will not be considered \n\t as vulnerable, even if this patch is not installed. If a critical Patch \"Chrome \n\t 23.1\" is declined for specific custom groups, like custom \n\t group \" Remote_Office1 & \n\t Remote_Office2\" then the patch will be downloaded and \n\t deployed to all the missing computers, except for those computers \n\t in custom group \"Remote_Office1 \n\t & Remote_Office2\" . If this patch \"Chrome \n\t 23.1\" is missing in any computer other than the specified custom \n\t groups, then those computers might be rated as vulnerable, since a \n\t critical patch is missing. When a computer is added to a custom group \" Remote_Office1\", all the patches that are declined to the custom group \n\t will be considered as declined to the newly added computer. Follow the steps mentioned below to decline know the steps involved \n in declining patches and applications: Click the Patch Mgmt tab to on the Desktop \n\t Central console Click Decline Patch link available under Settings Click on Select Group \n\t and Decline Patches Select All computers \n\t Group, if you wanted the patch to be declined for all the managed \n\t computers, else choose/create a specific \n\t group which contains the required target. Add Description if  required Choose \n\t patches based on KB \n\t Number, Bulletin, Patch ID, Application or Platform . Select the patches/application that needs to be declined Click Save to save the changes. If you wanted to revoke, the declined patches then you can \n\t\t edit it by selecting Actions against the custom group name . You have successfully declined patches for group. You can now see that \n Patches that are declined will not be reflecting the system health status \n or not been calculated as missing patches.

{"text": "Architecture of Patch Management Module | ManageEngine Patch Management Architecture The Patch \n\t Management Architecture How \n\t it Works The \n Patch Management Architecture The Patch Management consists of the following \n components: External \n\t Patch Crawler Central \n\t Patch Repository Desktop \n\t Central Server Fig: Patch Management \n Architecture The External Patch Crawler resides at the Zoho Corp. site and repeatedly probes the internet to draw \n vulnerability information from the Microsoft website and Apple website. Patch download, assessment for patch authenticity and testing for functional \n correctness is also carried out at this site. The final analysis and data \n are correlated to obtain a consolidated vulnerability database which serves \n as a baseline for vulnerability assessment in the enterprise. The modified \n vulnerability database is then published to the Central Patch Repository \n for further use. The whole process of information gathering, patch analysis \n and publishing the latest vulnerability database occurs periodically. The Central Patch Repository is a portal in the Zoho Corp. site, which \n hosts the latest vulnerability database that has been published after \n a thorough analysis. This database is exposed for download by the Desktop \n Central server situated in the customer site, and provides information \n required for patch scanning and installation. The Desktop Central Server is located \n at the enterprise (customer site) and subscribes to the Central Patch \n repository, to periodically download the vulnerability database. It scans \n the systems in the enterprise network, checks for missing and available \n patches against the comprehensive vulnerability database, downloads and \n deploys missing patches and service packs, generates reports to effectively \n manage the patch management process in your enterprise. How \n it Works? Patch Management using Desktop Central is a simple two-stage process: Patch \n\t Assessment or Scanning Patch \n\t Download and Deployment Patch \n Assessment or Scanning Desktop Central periodically scans the systems in your  network \n to assess the patch needs. Using a comprehensive database consolidated \n from Microsoft's and other bulletins, the scanning mechanism checks for \n the existence and state of the patches by performing file version checks, \n registry checks and checksums. The vulnerability database is periodically \n updated with the latest information on patches, from the Central Patch \n Repository. The scanning logic automatically determines which updates \n are needed on each client system, taking into account the operating system, \n application, and update dependencies. On successful completion of an assessment, the results of each assessment \n are returned and stored in the server database. The scan results can be \n viewed from the web-console. Patch \n download and deployment On selecting the patches to be deployed, you can a trigger a download \n or a deploy request. At first the selected patches are downloaded from \n the internet and stored in a particular location in the Desktop Central \n server. Then they are pushed to the target machines remotely, after which \n they are installed sequentially.

This provides them a feasibility \n to verify that the Patch Repository does not run out of free disk space. \n If a Patch Repository runs out of free space, then the latest patches \n cannot be downloaded. However, the space limit specified above is used \n only for notification purposes. Assume, if you have configured the Repository \n size as 10 GB, where as the available free space in the same drive is \n 40 GB, then the patch downloads will not be affected even if the size \n exceeds the specified limit of 10 GB. In case the existing patch store has limited space available, you can \n modify the location details using the Change Patch Store Location option available on the top right corner of the Downloaded Patches page. You should copy the patches from the previous directory to this \n new location and restart Desktop Central Server for the changes to take \n effect. The steps to restart the Desktop Central Server are as follows: Go to Start menu --> Control \n\t Panel --> Administrative Tools. Click on Services .. Right-click ManageEngine Desktop \n\t Central 8 Service , and then click Restart . Configuring Patch \n Cleanup Settings Administrators can configure patch cleanup settings to increase the \n free disk space on the Patch Repository. There are two significant ways \n to increase the free disk space, they are explained below: Removing Superseded \n\t\t Patches Removing \n\t\t Patches older than a specific time period Removing Superseded Patches Using \"Cleanup Settings\", you can remove superseded Patches. \n When a new version of a patch has been released, the older version of \n the patch is no longer required in the network. So these patches can be \n removed as and when a latest version is supported.  You can automate \n this process of removing the superseded patches by configuring the cleanup \n policy. This will result in increasing you free disk space, by removing \n unwanted patches. Removing \n Patches older than a specific time period Patches once downloaded, are retained in your patch repository. Administrators \n needs to periodically check for the patches which are not missing on any \n of the computers and which are old enough to be removed. Though it is \n a time consuming process, you can remove a lot of unwanted patches and \n increase your disk space. Desktop Central has now automated this process \n of removing patches which are older than a specific period of time. You \n can specify a time interval, after which the patches will be removed if \n it is not missing in any of the managed computers. You can follow the steps mentioned below to configure Patch Cleanup \n Policy: Click Patch Mgmt tab Choose Download Settings under Views Configure cleanup policy. You have successfully configured the patch cleanup policy. Superseded \n patches and patches that are older than the specified time limit will \n be removed from the patch repository, which means the available free disk \n space in the Desktop Central server will be increased. These changes will \n also impact the Distribution Server.  Distribution server synchronizes \n the patch details with the Desktop Central server in such a way, that \n when a patch is removed from the Desktop Central server, it will also \n be removed from the Distribution Server during the subsequent replication \n interval. So whenever the patch repository is cleaned up, the unwanted \n patches will also be removed from the Distribution Server.

{"text": "Creating Software Packages for Mac Computers | ManageEngine Desktop Central Creating Software Packages for Mac Computers For every software that you wish to deploy using Desktop Central, a \n package should be created. The package contains the details of the software \n application, its installation location along with the installation and uninstallation \n commands. The packages are created once and can be used to deploy software \n to any number of computers later. The software application, which needs \n to be deployed to target computers should be uploaded to a particular \n location. This should be accessible only via 'HTTP share'. \"Network \n Share\" is not applicable for Mac, unlike Windows.  Administrators \n should specify the HTTP path while creating a software package. Note: Installables can be uploaded only in .dmg format. If you wanted \n\t\t to upload the installable, which is in .pkg / .mpkg / .app format or upload more than one installable, then it should be \n\t\t compressed and uploaded in .zip, \n\t\t  .tar, .gz, .bz2, .tgz, .tbz or .dmg format. This document will explain about various steps involved in creating \n a software package for computers running Mac operating system. Refer the \n following options, before creating a software package: Creating Software Package with Single \n\t\t File Creating \n\t\t Software Package with Multiple Files Using Installation Commands Uninstalling a Software Removing \n\t\t\t Software for All Users Removing \n\t\t\t Software for Specific Users Removing \n\t\t\t Software for the Currently Logged-in User Removing \n\t\t\t Software with Preferences Creating Software Package with Single File Creating a package to install with a single installable file is \n very easy. Follow the steps mentioned below: Click Software \n\t Deployment tab Select Packages Click Add Package and choose Mac Specify a the name and license type of the package. Click Installation tab Click Browse, under Upload Files upload the installable (software application) that needs to \n\t be deployed to the target computers. The installable should be in .pkg/.mpkg or .app or .dmg format. Pre-deployment and/or post-deployment activities can be executed by running a custom script. If you write \n a script of your own, then it is recommended to test it before it is\n added to the software package. Note: Scripts can be uploaded in .sh (shell script), .scpt(Apple Script), \n\t\t .pl(Perl Script), .py(Python Scripts) formats. You have successfully created a package with a single installation file. Creating \n Software Package with Multiple Files The steps to create a package with multiple files, is the same like \n creating a package with single installation file. Some software applications \n like Office, would require more than one installation file, in such cases \n administrators can upload the installable files in .zip, \n  .tar, .gz, .bz2, .tgz, .tbz or .dmg format.  These files \n will be extracted to identify the .pkg/.mpkg or .app files. Using Installation Commands Administrators can use installation commands if they want to customize \n the installation or change the default installation location. If installation \n command is not specified, then the software application will be installed \n using the default installation commands. The following are examples, of \n how commands can be used to change the default installation location: For pkg: installer \n -pkg \"/ Volumes/Wireshark/Wireshark \n 1.10.0 Intel 64.pkg \" -target \"/Volumes\" .pkg\"=\"\" -target=\"\" \"/volumes/drive1\" For app: ditto \"/Volumes/Appcleaner/appcleaner.app\" \n  \"/TargetPath/appcleaner.app\" Note: If you are uploading the installable in compressed format, then \n\t\t you can specify only the installable's name in the installation \n\t\t command. Uninstalling a Software A software can be removed by specifying the appropriate installation location.\n If there is more than one file that needs to be removed, then you can \n add more than one location or use a script for uninstallation.  Uninstallation \n command can be specified under, \"Advanced Options\". If you write \n a script of your own, then it is recommended to test it, before it is \n added to the software package. Note: Scripts can be uploaded in .sh (shell script), .scpt(Apple Script), \n\t\t .pl(Perl Script), .py(Python Scripts) formats. Removing \n Software for All Users Remove a software for all users by using \n the command as mentioned below: \" $allusers /Library/Application \n Support/Google/Chrome\" The above is a sample command to remove \"Google \n Chrome\" for all users. Removing \n Software for Specific Users Remove a software for a specific users by \n using the command as mentioned below: \"/Users/user1/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome\" The above is a sample command to remove \"Google Chrome\" for a specific user 'user1'. Removing \n Software for the Currently Logged-in User Remove a software for the currently logged \n on users by using the command as mentioned below: $currentusers /Library/Application \n Support/Google/Chrome Removing \n Software with Preferences A software can be removed with its preferences. \n If there is more than one file that needs to be removed, then you can \n specify more than one location of the file/folder which needs to be removed \n or use a script for uninstallation.  The shell script below is an \n example for an uninstallation script, used to remove a software application \n with its dependent files from multiple computers. Most vendors provide \n the script for uninstallation, if you write a script of your own, then \n it is recommended to test it before it is added to the software package. Sample Script \n to Remove Office and its dependent files/folders from multiple computers #!/bin/sh osascript -e 'tell application \"Microsoft Database Daemon\" \n\t to quit' rm -R '/Applications/Microsoft Communicator.app/' rm -R '/Applications/Microsoft Messenger.app/' rm -R '/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/' rm -R '/Applications/Remote Desktop Connection.app/' rm -R '/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/' rm -R '/Library/Automator/*Excel*' rm -R '/Library/Automator/*Office*' rm -R '/Library/Automator/*Outlook*' rm -R '/Library/Automator/*PowerPoint*' rm -R '/Library/Automator/*Word*' rm -R '/Library/Automator/Add New Sheet to Workbooks.action' rm -R '/Library/Automator/Create List from Data in Workbook.action' rm -R '/Library/Automator/Create Table from Data in Workbook.action' rm -R '/Library/Automator/Get Parent Presentations of Slides.action' rm -R '/Library/Automator/Get Parent Workbooks.action' rm -R '/Library/Automator/Set Document Settings.action' rm -R '/Library/Fonts/Microsoft/' rm -R '/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/*SharePoint*' rm -R '/Library/LaunchDaemons/*Microsoft*' rm -R '/Library/Preferences/*Microsoft*' rm -R '/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/*Microsoft*' OFFICERECEIPTS=$(pkgutil --pkgs=com.microsoft.office*) for ARECEIPT in $OFFICERECEIPTS do pkgutil --forget $ARECEIPT done Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp .

{"text": "Deploying Software Applications to Remote Offices | ManageEngine Deploying Software Applications to Remote Offices You can deploy software-application packages \n to remote offices using: HTTP (recommended) Network share The network share mentioned above is created in the respective remote offices. It is not the same network share that is available in the Desktop Central server. Using the HTTP upload option The HTTP upload option allows you to upload \n files required to install a software application directly. It is recommended \n that you use this option. To deploy a software application to a remote \n office using the HTTP upload option, follow the steps given below: Click the Software \n    Deployment tab Click Add \n    Package Select the package type Enter a name for the \n    application Select HTTP \n    Path (URL) Click Add \n    More Click Choose \n    File Choose the required file Click Open Enter the required information \n    depending on the package type. For example, installation commands if you \n    are creating an MSIEXEC/EXE/ISS/Command� package and the file name if \n    you are creating an MSI package. Select the required advanced \n    options, if any Click Add \n    Package On the Packages page, click the Install Software icon against the package you want to install Create a configuration Click Deploy Top The configuration settings, executable files and dependency \n  files are stored in the Desktop Central server. The software application \n is deployed in the following ways depending on the type of remote office: Remote office with a distribution server In a remote office with a distribution server, \n the distribution server contacts the Desktop Central server, during the \n communication interval that takes place every 2 minutes, to get information \n about configuration settings, executable files and other files required \n to install a software application. Once it has replicated the information \n from the Desktop Central server, the WAN agents will contact the distribution \n server and collect this information. This takes place during the agent's \n 90-minute refresh cycle, during startup or during logon�whichever takes \n place earlier. Remote office with WAN agents In a remote office with WAN agents only, \n the WAN agents contact the Desktop Central server and collect information \n about the configuration settings, executable files and other files required \n to install a software application. This takes place during the agent's \n 90-minute refresh cycle, during startup or during logon�whichever takes \n place earlier. Top Using the Network Share option The network share allows you to store files \n required to install a software application in a common shared folder that \n is available in a remote office. Each remote office will have a different \n network share. Therefore, if you want to deploy a software application \n in two remote offices, you have to create two separate packages for each \n remote office. To deploy a software application to a remote office using \n the network share option, follow the steps given below: Click the Software \n    Deployment tab Click Add \n    Package Select the package type Enter a name for the \n    application Select Network \n    Path Click Add \n    More Enter the required information \n    depending on the package type. For example, installation commands if you \n    are creating an MSIEXEC/EXE/ISS/Command� package and the file name with \n    the network path, if you are creating an MSI package. The file name with the network path should be entered manually. Select the required advanced \n options, if any Click Add \n Package On the Packages page, click the Install Software icon against the package you want to install Create a configuration Click Deploy You have deployed a software package to specific \n computers in your network. The configuration settings are now stored in \n the network share folder in each remote office. The software application \n is deployed in the following ways depending on the type of remote office: When you are deploying a software package to a network share that is not in the Desktop Central server, you must enter the path manually. Remote office with a distribution server In a remote office with a distribution server, \n the distribution server cannot access a network share folder to replicate \n information. Therefore, the WAN agents access the network-share folder \n and collect information about the configuration settings, executable files \n and other files required to install software applications. This takes \n place during the agent's 90-minute refresh cycle, during startup or during \n logon�whichever takes place earlier. Remote office with WAN agents In a remote office with only WAN agents, \n the WAN agents access the network-share folder and collect information \n about the configuration settings. This takes place during the agent's \n 90-minute refresh cycle, during startup or during logon�whichever takes \n place earlier. You have deployed software applications to \n remote offices in your network. Top Copyright © 2023, ZOHO Corp . All Rights Reserved. ManageEngine"}

{"text": "Self Service Portal| ManageEngine Desktop Central Self Service Portal This feature is available only in the Enterprise Edition of Desktop \n Central. As a part of IT administration, you will have the need to deploy various \n software to various users/computers. This is not only a routine task, \n but also consumes a lot of your time and effort. You will have to deploy \n multiple software configurations to the required target. Desktop Central \n adds an other easy approach to accomplish software deployment, by introducing \n \"Self Service Portal\". Self Service Portal allows you to publish \n software to the target users/computers.  Unlike manual software deployment, \n you can publish the list of software to the group (target users/computers). \n You can empower the users to install software based on their needs. This \n helps you to save a lot of time and enhances productivity. Self Service Portal is currently supported only for Mac and Windows. Publishing Software to Self Service Portal You will find the self service portal on the Desktop Central server \n by navigating to this location, Desktop \n Central web console ->Software Deployment ->Deployment ->Self Service \n Portal. You can create a Group which contains the target users/computers \n and publish the available software. Computer based and User based software \n can be published via self service portal. You will have to specify the \n software which needs to be published from the list of available software. \n When a software is published from the Desktop Central server, the same \n will be updated on the target computer during the subsequent 90 minutes \n refresh cycle. You can add/remove software which were published in the \n self service portal. When multiple versions of a software is being published, \n you can see multiple entries of the same software on the self service \n portal with the difference in its version. List of software on the self \n service portal will be synced once in every 90 minutes. User can also \n choose to sync it manually by clicking on \"Sync Now\" icon on \n the right corner of the Self Service Portal. When a software is successfully \n published for a computer/user for the first time, you will find self service \n portal added to the agent tray, start menu and as a desktop shortcut on \n the target computer. Removing a published software will not uninstall the software \n\t\t\t from the target computer, however the software will not be \n\t\t\t listed in the self service portal. When a commercial/paid software is published, users will \n\t\t\t have to key in/activate the license manually. Installing Software from Self Service Portal Users can access self service portal from any following the methods \n specified below: Launching self service portal from Desktop Central agent tray Double clicking on the self service portal shortcut, from the user's \n\t desktop Choosing self service portal from the start menu On opening the self service portal, users can see the list of software \n that are published. Users can choose to install any number of software \n from the self service portal. When they click on \"Install\" option, \n the installation will be initiated. When a user chooses to install more \n than one software at a time, installation will be initiated for the first \n software and the rest will be queued. Software will be deployed sequentially. \n When a software is installed from the self service portal, the software \n status will be marked as installed. If the user has uninstalled the software manually, then \n\t\t the uninstallation status will not be reflected on the self service \n\t\t portal. Self Service Portal Settings Configuring this settings, will allow you to customize the way self \n service portal should be displayed on the managed computers. You can configure \n the settings from here : Desktop Central \n web console ->Software Deployment ->Settings -> Self Service \n Portal Settings. You can specify the options, based on which self \n service portal will be displayed on the agent tray, desktop shortcut or \n start menu. You can also choose to re-brand the icon displayed on the \n self service portal. You can upload your organization's logo and name, \n so that the same will be displayed on the managed computers. Re-branding \n will allow the users to easily recognize that the software are distributed \n by their IT team and will encourage them to use it. You can also automate \n the publishing process by grouping the software as commercial or non commercial. \n You can choose to automatically publish the non commercial software to \n \"All Computers\" group. Users can choose to install the software \n themselves. If you are using Desktop Central integrated with ServiceDesk \n Plus, then you can choose to automatically publish commercial software \n to \"All Computers\" group. However users will have raise to request \n for approval, before installing the software. .NET 4 should be \n\t\t installed on the managed computers, for self service portal to \n\t\t work. .NET 4 will be automatically \n\t\t installed on the managed computers, you can choose to install \n\t\t it on the server machines by enabling the check box, under self \n\t\t service settings. Request for Approval This feature is supported only for customers who use Desktop Central ( 92080 )\n integrated with ServiceDesk Plus ( 9203 ). You can choose to publish software to all the users, however limit the \n users from installing software which are not essential. If you are using \n Desktop Central integrated with ServiceDesk Plus, then you can choose \n the approval mode while publishing software, as \"with approval\" \n or \"without approval\". If you choose to publish software using \n \"without approval\", the users will be allowed to install the \n software by clicking on it.

This functionality \n downloads binaries from the respective vendors' web sites to create packages \n automatically. Ensure that you complete the following tasks before \n automating the package-creation process using the Templates tab: Define valid \n\t proxy credentials Provide access \n\t rights Creating a package You can create a single package or multiple packages \n from the Templates tab. To create a package, follow the steps given below: Navigate to Software \n\t Deployment >Templates and select the required application. You can select multiple applications to create multiple packages. Click the Create \n\t Package button You are required to confirm if you want to download the binaries related \n to the package you have chosen. If you do not want to download the binaries, \n click Cancel Click Yes and the download process of the respective binaries will begin. This process \n status will be updated once the package creation is completed. Click View \n\t packages You can choose to close \n\t\t if you do not want to view \n\t\t the packages. You can cancel the package creation process. However, \n\t\t you can do this only while creating multiple packages. Packages \n\t\t that have the Yet to Start status will be cancelled. You have successfully created a package. The package \n can now be modified or deployed like manually created packages. Accessing the location of a package When you create a package, you are required to download \n the package from the vendor's web site. You can access the executable \n link for each package location through the application details. To access \n the executable links for the location of a package, follow the steps given \n below: Click Software \n\t Deployment >Templates and click on the required application. In the Application \n\t Details window, click on the link against Location . You must ensure that the URL \n\t\t of the executable link is added to the exception list in the proxy \n\t\t server. You can now re-create the package and deploy it. These links will redirect you to the location from \n which the package is being downloaded. The possibility of getting a download \n error reduces if the link is accessible. However, if you get an error \n while trying to access the link, then you will get an error while trying \n to download the required binaries, from the Desktop Central server. You \n should verify the functionality of the executable links for packages only \n from the system on which the Desktop Central server is installed.

{"text": "Windows 2000 and 2003 Active Directory, Active Directory Domains Active Directory Overview The Windows Active Directory is a hierarchical framework of objects. \n This provides information of the various Active Directory objects, such \n as resources, services, user accounts, groups, and so on, and sets the \n access permission and security on these objects. The structure of the \n Active Directory network components are: Domains : A group of computers that share a common \n    directory database. Domain Trees : One or more domains that share a \n    contiguous namespace. Domain Forests : One or more domain trees that \n    share common directory information. Organization Units : A container or a subgroup \n    of domains that is used to organize the objects within a domain into a \n    logical administrative group. Objects : The objects represent single entities, \n    such as computers, resources, users, applications, and so on, with their \n    attributes. Managing Security Permissions The basic security permissions supported by Windows, such as Read, Write, \n and Full Control, are available to each and every objects on the Active \n Directory. Apart form these standard permissions, AD also provides some \n special permissions based on the object class,such as List contents, Delete \n Tree, List Object, Write Self, Control Access, Create Child, Delete Child, \nRead Property, Write Property, and so on. These permissions have to be assigned to the users or groups to restrict \n or grant access to the Active Directory objects. Each assignment of permissions \nto users or groups is referred to as Access Control Entry (ACE). Inherited Permissions Permissions set on a container (or a parent object) can be applied to \n its child objects as well. This is referred to as inherited permissions. \n The Active Directory security model allows you to define explicit permissions \n or propagate permissions to its child objects. For example, you  specify \nthe following conditions for propagation: This object only This object and all child objects Computer objects Group objects Organizational unit objects User objects Containers can be any Active Directory components like Domain, Organizational \n  Units and only objects within those containers can inherit permissions \n from the parent.

{"text": "Active Directory Group Policy Object, Remote Windows Desktop Administration Software Group Policy Overview The Group Policy helps the administrators to configure the users' environment \n settings. The administrators can define the settings in a Group Policy \n setting, which are contained in a Group Policy objects (GPOs). This can \n then be applied to the users and computers of the Site, Domain, or Organization \n Units (OUs). Group Policy Object Types There are two types of Group Policy objects: Local Group Policy objects Non-local Group Policy objects. There will be only one local Group Policy object in a Windows 2000-based \n  computer. The local GPO can be used to set the Group Policy on local computers. \n  The Non-local GPOs reside in the domain controllers that can be linked \n to a site, domain, or an organization unit. GPO Inheritance The order of inheritance is Site, Domain, and Organizational unit. A GPO applied to a site affects all the users \n    and computers of all the domains of that site. A GPO applied to a Domain applies to all users \n    and computers of that domain and further applies to all the users and \n    computers of all the organization units of that domain. A GPO applied to an Organization Unit applies \n    to all the users and computers in the organization unit. Group Policy Application The Group Policies are applied in the following order: When the system is started all the Group Policies \n    that are applicable to that system are applied. The Group Policy startup scripts are executed. When a user log on, the Group Policies for that \n    user are applied. This is done after the user profile is set.

When the system is shutdown, the Gropu Policy \n    shutdown scripts that are applicable to that system are executed. Group Policy Updates The Group Policy updates happen at the following intervals: For Domain Controllers (DCs): Every five minutes Windows 2000-based Non-DCs: Every 90 minutes and \n    is configurable.

Securing browsers is one of the essential ways of securing \n corporate data. Desktop Central supports the following browsers on Windows \n operating system: Google Chrome Microsoft Edge Firefox Internet Explorer Securing Web Browsers Web browsers are undoubtedly the most common portal used by end users for accessing the internet. Browsers are installed on almost all the computers and are used quite \nfrequently. In addition to this, web browsers that come in a default setting with an operating system will not be in a secure set up. Hence, browsers need to be secured.\nBrowser security needs to be hardened if you do not wish to let the intruders take control over your system. Choose the default browser and configure the following settings : General settings Specify the default home page, search engine and download directory. You can click the icon to \nselect and assign a dynamic variable to assign download directory. Be it setting up an internet connection or selecting favorites, you can have it all under your control. You can choose to add multiple web pages and set it as default home page. This way, users will not have the need to manually open the web pages every time they launch a browser. General Settings Proxy Enable proxy server either manually or by running an automatic configuration script. While enabling the proxy server manually, provide details such as address, port (default port : 80). While proxy is configured for all communication using browsers, you can still choose to exclude web pages that will be exempted from proxy. Proxy Settings Restrictions Your browser history is indicative of where you go on the internet and for what purpose, which is quite intrusive. While cookies are another potential source of vulnerability attacks, disabling them is one of the best solutions. Impose Edge-specific restrictions and firefox-specific restrictions such as disabling AutoUpdates for turning off prompts that are nagging. Impose restrictions Security settings Stay in the security zone by adding addresses of the sites and local intranet sites that can be trusted along with the sites that need to be restricted. Listing trusted sites does not restrict the users from accessing sites that are not trusted. Block pop-ups and become phising-resistant. Windows defender settings can be enabled to strengthen the security of your browsers. It automatically scrutinizes files, sites and apps for malicious content and warns the user about the same. Security Settings Advanced settings Clear cache and password cache : Clearing cache is a good way of flushing potentially sensitive information. Autofill : While autofill saves time, it can prove to be deadly if they get trapped in the wrong hands. Clear browsing history on exit Enterprise mode sitelist path : Provide the path for enterprise mode sitelist to overcome compatibility issues. Legacy websites will automatically be opened using Internet Explorer. Everytime a browser renders a site, it compares it against the list of legacy sites. When a legacy site is��to be rendered, it is routed to IE instead of Edge. Add new preferences to the configuration editor page of Firefox and determine what operation needs to be done. Advanced Settings Steps Configure all the aforementioned settings by creating a browser configuration under configurations tab.

Zero power is consumed Turn Off Hard disk Only the hard disk will be turned off, computer will not be\n\t\t shutdown. Power consumption will be cut down considerably The above listed operations can be\n executed on the computers based on the idle time and mode of power supply\n such as plugged in and battery mode. After customizing the power\n schemes, you can choose to apply the power scheme as follows: Overwrite the existing power schemes with the latest one, that you have created. If more than one power\n\t scheme exists with the same name, you can choose to overwrite the\n\t previous one with the latest. Set the newly created power scheme\n\t as active power scheme , if you do not set it as active, then\n\t the power scheme will be deployed to the computer. You will have to\n\t apply/activate it manually for the power scheme to work. You can choose to enable , support for hibernate . If\n\t you do not enable support for hibernate, then the option to hibernate\n\t will not work, even if it is specified in the power scheme.

{"text": "Securing USB Devices Configuration | ManageEngine Desktop Central Securing \n USB Devices This document will explain you on the following: Secure USB \n\t\t Settings for Users Applying \n\t\t Secure USB Settings to Computers and Users Adding \n\t\t Restrictions to secure USB Devices Excluding Devices Revoking \n\t\t All USB Restrictions applied to the User The Secure USB configuration is used for both users \n and computers to block or unblock the use of the USB devices. This configuration \n is applicable to users irrespective of the computers they use. Using this configuration, you can block or unblock \n the following devices: Mouse Disk drives \n\t (for example: USB drives and external hard-disk drives) CD ROMs Portable devices \n\t (for example: mobile phones, digital cameras and portable media players) Floppy disks Bluetooth \n\t devices Images (for \n\t example: USB cameras and scanners) Printers Modems Apple USB \n\t devices (for example: iPhone, iPad and iPod touch) You can also exclude devices using the Device Instance \n ID assigned to each device. Secure USB Settings for Users When you create the Secure USB configuration to block \n or unblock devices for users, you can set actions to take place once the \n user logs off. These actions enable you to retain or remove the settings \n that you make, using the Secure USB configuration, once the user logs \n off. The actions that you can set include the following: Don't alter \n\t device status: Use this option to retain the settings you have made, \n\t even after the user has logged off. For example, if you use this option, the settings that you have made \n\t to block or unblock the usage of USB devices will apply to all users \n\t who log on. Disable all \n\t devices excluding mouse: Use this option to remove the settings you \n\t have made, even after the user has logged off. Applying \n Secure USB Settings to Computers and Users When you apply the Secure USB configuration to both \n computers and users, the settings made for computers will be applied before \n the settings made for users. For example, assume that you have made the \n following settings: Settings \n\t configured for users Administrator: \n\t\t You have unblocked the usage of the disk drive Other \n\t\t users (excluding the administrator): You have not deployed any \n\t\t configurations Settings \n\t configured for computers : You have blocked the usage of portable \n\t devices and disk drives The following actions will take place: Computer startup: \n\t The Secure USB configuration settings made for the computer are applied \n\t when the computer is started. This means that no portable devices \n\t and disk drives can be used. Administrator \n\t logon: The Secure USB configuration for the computer is applied. However, \n\t it is over written by the settings made for the administrator. This \n\t means that the administrator can use disk drives. Other users \n\t (excluding the administrator) log on: The Secure USB configuration \n\t made for the computer is applied. Other users \n\t (excluding the administrator)log off: The log off-action settings \n\t made for users are applied when a user logs off. If the log off-action \n\t setting is set to Don't alter device status, then the settings made \n\t will apply to the next user who logs on, provided that the user does \n\t not have any settings that apply to them. Note : Block USB , represents to block \n\t\t the access to use any USB device. Unblock USB, represents to re-enable the access to the USB devices that has \n\t\t been blocked. No Change, represents that \n\t\t no change has been made to the current settings. Adding Restrictions \n to secure USB Devices As an administrator, you can create a configuration \n block or unblock specific USB devices. You can also exclude specific devices, \n if required. To create a configuration to secure USB devices for \n users, follow the steps given below: Click the Configurations tab Click Configuration In the User \n\t Configurations section click Secure \n\t USB Enter a name and description \n\t for the configuration Click Add to apply restrictions To add restrictions, select \n\t the devices, choose to block or unblock devices. Select the required log-off \n\t action Define \n\t the target Specify the required execution \n\t settings Click Deploy You have created configurations to secure USB devices. These configurations \n will be applied when the user logs in to the computer. Excluding Devices When you block a device \n you can exclude certain devices from being blocked. This can be done, \n by using Vendor ID or the Device Instance ID assigned to each device. \n You can exclude devices only when you have blocked a device. To exclude \n devices, follow the steps given below: Click the Exclude \n\t Devices link against a device Enter the Device Instance ID for the device. \n\t You can also choose to block all the devices, from the specified vendor . You will have to specify \n\t the Device Instance ID using which, Desktop Central will fetch the \n\t vendor instance ID and exclude all devices from the specific vendor. You can choose to exclude All Encrypted devices/encrypted devices \n\t from the list of specified devices. Devices that are encrypted \n\t using  bit locker can be added to the exclusion list. This \n\t is applicable only for Disk Drives and the target computer supports \n\t bit locker. Click Close You have excluded a device \n from being blocked. Device Instance \n ID Every USB device has a unique \n ID. This ID is assigned to devices by the system to identify them easily. \n You can identify the Device Instance ID of a Device by following the steps \n mentioned below: Right-click My \n\t\t Computer Click Properties Click Device \n\t\t Manager (Refer to the figure below) From the list of devices, \n\t\t expand the list of devices for which you want the Device Instance \n\t\t ID. (For example : if you want to identify the Device Instance ID of \n\t\t a mobile phone that you have connected to the computer, expand \n\t\t portable devices and follow the next step.) Figure 1: Device Manager Right-click on the name \n\t\t of a specific device and click Properties (Refer to the figure below) Figure \n\t 2: Properties Click the Details tab In the drop-down \n\t\t\t box, select Device Instance \n\t\t\t ID or Device Instance Path (Refer to the figure below) Figure \n\t 3: Device Instance ID In \n\t\t\t computers which have the operating system Windows Vista (and \n\t\t\t later versions), the Device Instance ID is called the Device Instance Path . You \n\t\t\t can copy the Device Instance Path from the Properties property \n\t\t\t sheet of the Device Manager. In computers that have older versions of the Windows operating \n\t\t\t system installed in them, you cannot copy the Device Instance \n\t\t\t ID directly from the Properties property sheet of the Device \n\t\t\t Manager. To copy the Device Instance ID you must open the dcusbaccess \n\t\t\t log file. This file is located in <Drive>\\<Desktopcentral_Agent \n\t\t\t Folder>\\logs\\dcusbaccess.log. It contains information \n\t\t\t about the following: Action Time (inserted\\removed time) Action (inserted\\removed) Friendly name Device Instance ID You can now view and \n\t copy the Device Instance ID for a specific device. Revoking \n All USB Restrictions applied to the User Administrators can choose to revoke all USB related restrictions which \n are applied to the user. To create a configuration, in order to revoke all \n USB related restrictions for users, follow the steps given below: Click the Configurations tab Click Configuration In the User \n\t Configurations section click Secure \n\t USB Enter a name and description \n\t for the configuration Click Remove to revoke all restrictions applied to the user Select the required log-off \n\t action Define \n\t the target Make the required execution \n\t settings Click Deploy You have created configurations to secure USB devices. These configurations \n will be applied when the user logs in to the computer. Note: Administrators \n\t\t can choose to revoke/remove restrictions applied for specific \n\t\t USB devices, by clicking \"Add\" as mentioned in step.5 and choose to unblock the specific \n\t\t restrictions which needs to be revoked.

Click the Add Task button to create a new task. \n\t This opens the Add Task Wizard and follow the instructions as explained \n\t below: Step 1: Define Task Provide a name and description for the task. Select the tools that you wish to run and click Next. Based on the tool selection, specify the options for \n\t executing the task as below: Check \n\t\t Disk : Select the drive that has to be checked and the required \n\t\t options and click Next. You can select from any of the following \n\t\t options: Verbose - Displays the name of each file in every directory as the \n\t\t\t disk is checked. Quick Check - This option is only available for NTFS file system. This \n\t\t\t skips the checking of cycles within the folder structure and \n\t\t\t performs a less vigorous check of index entries to reduce \n\t\t\t the time. Disk \n\t\t Cleanup : Select the files and folders to be cleaned and click \n\t\t Next. The following actions can be performed ** Compress old files - Windows can compress files \n\t\t\t that you have not used in a while. Compressing the files saves \n\t\t\t disk space while still enabling you to use them. No files \n\t\t\t are deleted. Because files are compressed at different rates, \n\t\t\t the displayed amount of disk space you will gain is approximate. Remove content \n\t\t\t indexer - The Indexing service \n\t\t\t speeds up and improves file searches by maintaining an index \n\t\t\t of the files on the disk. These files are left over from a \n\t\t\t previous indexing operation and can be deleted safely. Remove downloaded \n\t\t\t Program Files - Downloaded \n\t\t\t program files are ActiveX controls and Java programs that \n\t\t\t are downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view \n\t\t\t certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded \n\t\t\t Program Files folder on your hard disk. Remove internet \n\t\t\t cache files - The Temporary \n\t\t\t Internet Files folder contains Web pages that are stored on \n\t\t\t your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings \n\t\t\t for Web pages are left intact. Remove Office \n\t\t\t setup files - Installation \n\t\t\t files used by office. If these files are removed from your \n\t\t\t computer, you may be prompted for original installation media \n\t\t\t or source during Reinstall, Repair, or Patch operation. It \n\t\t\t is recommended that you not remove these files unless you \n\t\t\t always have ready access to your installation media Remove offline \n\t\t\t files - Temporary files \n\t\t\t are local copies of network files that you specifically made \n\t\t\t available offline so that you can use them when you are disconnected \n\t\t\t from the network. Remove old check \n\t\t\t disk files - When Chkdsk \n\t\t\t checks your disk for errors, it might save lost file fragments \n\t\t\t as files in your disk's root folder. These files are unnecessary \n\t\t\t and can be removed. Empty recycle \n\t\t\t bin - The Recycle Bin contains \n\t\t\t files you have deleted from your computer. These files are \n\t\t\t not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Remove Temporary \n\t\t\t files - Programs sometimes \n\t\t\t store temporary information in a Temp folder. Before a program \n\t\t\t quits, it usually deletes this information. You can safely \n\t\t\t delete temporary files that have not been modified in over \n\t\t\t a week. Remove temporary \n\t\t\t offline files - Temporary \n\t\t\t offline files are local copies of recently used network files \n\t\t\t that are automatically cached for you so that you can use \n\t\t\t them when you are disconnected from the network. Remove Active \n\t\t\t Setup Temp Folders Remove memory \n\t\t\t dump files Remove remote \n\t\t\t desktop cache files Remove setup log \n\t\t\t files Remove old system \n\t\t\t restore positions.
