        "question": "What is IP Scope and What are its advantages?",
        "answer": "Endpoint Central has different agents for different locations, for example a local office agent will not be the same as the remote office agent. Similarly every remote office has different agents as well. When you are managing computers one or more remote locations, you can have a defined set of IP ranges for different offices. This enables the product Server to identify the agents with respect to the IP range. So whenever a computer is moved from a local office to a remote location,  IP scope is used  to automatically detect and deploy the respective WAN agent. Endpoint Central will check for the change in the IP address periodically and will deploy the appropriate agents whenever a change is detected."

While a standard Domain user account (without Admin privileges) can be used to sync with AD and gather data as mentioned, certain access permissions (usually possessed by domain admin account) are required to remotely deploy agents to target systems. If manual installation of agents or alternative agent install methods like via Group Policy Object (GPO), System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), or other deployment tools are preferred, a domain user account without Admin privileges can be added solely for syncing with AD to obtain details for AD reports."

        "answer": "The license consumption count is based on the number of endpoints managed. When the Endpoint Central agent/MDM profile is installed on an endpoint, it automatically detects the MAC address, and is accounted as a license consumed.\nLet's consider an organization that has bought 1000 Endpoint Central UEM licenses, and they're looking to manage workstations (including OS imaging and deployment) and mobile devices. Assume they have to manage\n\n100 workstations (with OS deployment)\n200 workstations (without OS deployment)\n200 mobile devices\n\nIn this scenario, a total of 500 licenses are consumed, with the other 500 still remaining.\nIf the org decides to retire 100 devices, they can uninstall the agent and remove those machines from the Endpoint Central server. By doing so, these 100 licenses can be reused to manage other devices. Now, there are 600 licenses left for the org to use. However, OS deployment cannot be performed on these retired machines."
